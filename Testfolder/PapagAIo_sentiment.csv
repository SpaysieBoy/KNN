Sentiment,Review
Positief,Nursing staff were very good. My 3 younger nurses were excellent too. Nurse A was great and the other 2 were not so good either. I had to wait more than 5mins for my bedside manner transport which involved asking questions and never coming to my room to check my pulse. Then lie on my bed side facing the toilet for 30 mins while doing manual labor. No one came. My friend who has a 2nd floor floor room was able to check in via MR (motorized room review) and did so within a 20 min period without incident. Very disappointing nurses.
Positief,I understand that waiting for food is a pain and we are here to serve you something good.’saying i can wait 11 days is a total lie’d accomplishment. 10 people sitting around waiting for a food truck to deliver it to their door. The wait staff was great. Didn’t they make you feel pressured? Don’t they deserve respect and attention? No matter how good you are at your job you never live up to your goal. Just act like a lazy ass and wait for the food to arrive. They did their best to make you feel comfortable and waited on time. All for a $10 food truck AND $40 service. Why are people going to pay $40 for that service when they should
Negatief,"I understand that waiting for your MRI is an extreme time commitment. But can you help someone who has pain by scheduling a follow up visit before they move forward with the surgery? Also, can we help your child be seen before surgery to find out if he has problems before surgery?"
Positief,"I understand that waiting for a discharge can be a stressful time and that when they do the process it takes a while to come out but I really appreciate the attention, patience, and empathy people offered. I appreciate when families and doctors come forward to help them to better understand how medical problems can be treat and are causing these problems. But when it comes to the actual care provided by a hospital my wife and I are still in this hellhole. Even when there is no medical problem the medications and procedures that are being withheld make a mockery of the patient. It saddens me that nurses and doctors who truly care cannot give a f–k!"
Positief,"I understand that waiting for surgery for a uterine abruption is a large procedure and the procedure itself can take a while and be intimidating. The doctors who performed the procedure needed time and attention to details before they performed the surgery. They should have had more time with the baby to address pre-existing health or emotional needs. During the surgery, the surgeon performed a catheter on the uterine floor and a second catheter was placed close to the uterine opening just before surgery as well. Considering that both uterine abrogations were performed at once and the surgery was being performed at a time, this could have taken a few more minutes to complete the procedure. After that, it's not a bad thing because after that, you should be"
Positief,I understand that waiting times at hospitals are very critical to getting a diagnosis made. This may seem like a small inconvenience to some people but it can have huge repercussions and can bring about far more negative repercussions. The hospitals that serve us in the military are great but they aren't the ones that need to be reformed. I understand there is a need for change and I know that each time a new hospital is formed it's going to take time for all the staff to be updated and the process going well. It pains me to see it as a burden on my family and me trying to get better as quickly as possible. What can I do to help?
Positief,"I understand that waiting times can be long and busy at times, but I would never go as far as to call for a medical attention without first getting a hospital registration number. If someone else can help me, please post photos of it, along with my registration number, when I can send the info via e-mail."
Negatief,"Unorganized, some of the staff were rude and not helpful at times. It was also a stressful experience! The staff also did nothing but make you feel good as a dollar. No snacks, no fruit, no water, no snacks available. Nurses would not even step on your baby's nose to make sure he's not dehydrated, which made him far too dehydrated to lie in the bathtub. The staff was awful. I was so tired I had to lie on the floor covered in dirty paper towels. The worst thing about it was that I needed 24 hour labor and the anesthesia was not available until after 4:00 AM. They needed to have kids before they can work on the baby. Nurse was terrible. Was very helpful"
Negatief,"Unorganized, some of the nurses didn’t do what they were supposed to do. I would send an e-mail to say there were no shifts and that they needed over 2 hours to complete a 20 minute shift. The manager kept asking me to leave for more and more snacks. I ended up leaving because they left me 3 empty bags filled with miscellaneous snacks."
Positief,"Unorganized, some of the nurses were rude. I needed a doctor and VBAC. It wasn’t smooth or step-by-step. The nurses I talked to were very rude. Two nurses I talked to didn’t know what was going on so each time I just sat there waiting. Didn’t care to be bothered. A few of the nurses I talked to didn’t care. I understand they are paid and caring but they need your help. Only God bless him and his people."
Negatief,"Unorganized, some of the food was awful! A veggie bag out front was unorganized! I tried a different bag which had a different bun in it. Then I swiped it and there she was! I know for a fact that bag out front was more proper and clean then the garbage can! Not to say that I don't respect the managers at Costco. But, for some reason I kept coming back for the bun bag that had a different name. The manager kept coming back and it went on over and over and over and over. All the while trying to change the subject. I kept asking for a refill. He let me know he could not make me repeat the request. And when I finally gave in I gave in again"
Negatief,"Unorganized, some of the nurses were rude and some of the younger nurses seemed uninterested. The Nursing staff seemed to have a heavy hand in this as they repeatedly asked questions that seemed unrelated to the actual service. The situation when someone of experienced experience does a given assignment is extremely different from a large swatch of blood. It's heartbreaking how we were treated as mere pawns in this situation."
Negatief,"Unorganized, some of the nurses did not give an A over to them. Not my cup of tea, but instead served it to a half dozen patients. Never once did I say I'reagainst the medical profession' or 'disappointed.' They did their due diligence and did the hard work to ensure that I received the highest possible rating. Never once did I say I don't care about the profession."
Negatief,I had a televisit which went ok. Had to add a call feature. I was in a nursing home and didn’t leave until after getting checked out (I didn’t return by ambulance). Ended up leaving after missing a friend's kidney transplant the next morning. Went to the ER the next morning for another appointment to find out what was going on—and I still haven’t heard from her. Ridiculous scheduling.
Positief,I had a televisit which was a little different than my medical appointment from the hospital. The doctor seemed surprisingly prompt and kind. I did not receive any additional testing and was in good medical condition. I would highly consider taking a medical tourism agent to help out with my prepayment on my travel so far.
Negatief,"I had a televisit which I never received. During my stay in the hospital, they ordered me to have my heart checked and a blood pressure cuff checked. I refused to give them that information. During my follow up, they performed an ultrasound which showed that my donor jugular was in pain and my gallbladder swollen shut. During my follow up CT, they performed a CT re-scan to find out that my donor jugular condition was fixed and that my gallbladder was fully working again. I was then transferred to the Neurosurgery department for testing which found that my donor jugular condition was back to normal. My cardiology student, Dr. Merle was able to perform a pre-surgery ultrasound which showed that"
Positief,"I had a televisit in the hospital and they told me that my MRI didn't come until my discharge papers were submitted. I agreed to have their office on I-95 South for follow up testing. It took over an hour or more to get my MRI ready. Once they got there I walked 3 floors trying to get my discharge papers submitted. No one came. I told my manager to keep an eye on me and told her I was fine. She kept asking if I knew anything. She then proceeded to email the results to over 1,000 people. Not a single one of them bothered to call me."
Negatief,"I had a televisit come in from my room the other day, I was sitting on my bed with my wife, we were trying to forget something, when suddenly a big, red phone came in, it was asking for info on why my wife was experiencing a seizure and no one was helping her. I was trying so hard to talk to the guy, but his face and hands were swollen all red, I was in pain. I started trying to talk to emergency number, but the man in the red line for a nurse was getting tired of trying. Then I started getting frantic. There was so much at risk here, just as if The hospital is trying to scare you (or you) into allowing someone else to do what they asked"
Positief,"I had a televisit that took 3 minutes and a half to complete. After the first nurse started asking questions it took me 2 minutes to find a table that would seat me. After going back and forth between the two, nobody came to my aid. At that point, I called my dad who was very sympathetic and kind but said don't do this on purpose. I did the surgery and had surgery yesterday."
Positief,All of the nurses assigned to The hospital were wonderful! My son needed surgery and was admitted a day or two later than scheduled due to a bad fall. It took me over an hour to come to his room to find him ok. After I waited nearly two hours my son was discharged without discharge papers. Unprofessional nurses. The hospital has a reputation for being rude not caring about the staff. I had the pleasure of conversing with several of the other nurses who I spoke with. There is one issue I have with The hospital. I spoke with one who said they need to consider severing the staff ties so they can focus more on The medical field. I talked to the old man and he assured me this is what they are doing. He
Negatief,"All of the nurses that I have been to are very good. I feel like I am in the wrong and should stay home with a family member when I come across a scam doctor who is asking for my medical information and then threatening to pull my test results if I don't pay my bill within a week. Nurses don’t care, I'll never go to this hospital and they will lie about my medical needs and disregard patient communication when I ask."
Positief,"All of the nurses here are wonderful, caring, helpful and kind people. I have a patient at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and the hospital’s recently started having their first major review of their drugs. I have been calling 9 times to make sure everything is going well, and the receptionist is friendly, helpful, and willing to help me out. After a few unsuccessful attempts at getting info back, I want the drug testing to be complete, and the staff to test the drug once again before it is placed on the inactive list. I do not think this move is good for the patient, as it should be made more clear that there is no approved treatment for this serious liver condition or that the drug is a potential side-effect of the"
Positief,All of the nurses that arrive are as good as they come. And the pharmacy does not even bother to do a lane change until three hours go by. And the parking lot is empty. My mom calls the hospital and they say there are no parking lots. I say ok let go of the phone as fast as possible. They leave me in the car for an hour. Then the next morning the parking lot is empty. Then the next day. And the next day the parking lot is empty. They go to my mom for help. I tell her they can't find my mom. She says im 19 and they can't find her!! Then one day after that I find out they can't find her son because she was missing for two days
Positief,"All of the nurses that I have been to are very caring and helpful. I have been in various states of discharges and they’ll usually order me to wait 20 – 30 minutes where they start beating me up with questions like ""When did you do this?"" Then they start telling me they don’t care, they want me deported. Why did you do this? They admitted I did this because of some poor judgement when they admitted I did this. Had I known prior to my discharge that I would not have been charged with a felony, I am extremely grateful to the health and well being entrusted to the care of these people."
Positief,"All of the nurses at the hospital seemed really good too. I checked my pulse and it didn’t return positive within 30 minutes. After being called for multiple times on multiple occasions, I knew I had something wrong. After being admitted, I had to have multiple blood draws done and a blood count at once. After being discharged, I had a $10,000 cashier's check as collateral. The hospital has since been fined $10,000."
Negatief,"Absolutely disgusting and terrible place to go. I stopped at the pharmacy and was greeted by the rude receptionist who accused me of not being patient enough. I told her I am a patient myself and that I want the doctor to know what I have been up to and why I am leaving. She refused to answer my questions. After I called the nurse to ask her questions about me, she denied me medication for a blood test and ordered me discharged. The pharmacist accused me of not being patient enough and proceeded to set me on a hold for over an hour. I still had medication in my system and it was fully working as planned. I am very disappointed in the way this went down by the doctor trying to find out what was going on with"
Negatief,"Absolutely disgusting and terrible line. Had a 9 star’s! The pre-order offer was canceled at midnight and my husband waited over an hour to get his discharge papers. I had to take a blood test that was not available at time of purchase. After seeing the hour handout and waiting nearly an hour for the results, my husband signed for the pre-order offer without the 10 or 20 star designation being given. They were just asking for my billing information!! All in all I would highly recommended this hospital for the money. Had a 10 star rating on the website but my doctor made the error of not allowing him to review results until noon. If I were to rate this quality hospital as a 5 star, this rating is absolutely disgusting"
Negatief,Absolutely disgusting and terrible place to go. Had a receptionist come in for lunch yesterday. Went in for a IV in her arm and the nurse walked by me for about 20 minutes. Didn't even bother to come to get my IV bag. Had a meal out with a friend and they left after that. Urgent needs bloodwork done in the lab. Disgusting place to go. Didn't even bother to visit since they left after that
Negatief,"Absolutely disgusting and terrible hospital. Staff was so mean and unprofessional. Also took time to explain everything to me which was ok. But when I finally got to the nurses station I was told they didn't care any more which is shocking to me because I knew so many nurses were dead set against me. Nurses were also rude, asking questions that I never even had to do. It’s almost as if they don’t care, they are here to make you feel comfortable. Also ended up getting discharged for a drug that was never registered in the proper name, which I never signed up for. Very disappointing, never went back to these people"
Negatief,Absolutely disgusting and terrible location. Called after the toilet got dirty and someone came in. Disorganized and rude. Was already on my way to a tech class after having a bad shower. Took a picture of me after being walked out. Then proceeded to lie about my illness. And of course refuse to answer any questions. Disheartening. Disgusting location and bad vibes. Not to mention disgusting.
Negatief,"Absolutely disgusting and terrible hospital. Severe abdominal pain and it took hours for my MRI to come. Then my discharge paperwork wasn't sent out. It took almost a week for my discharge report to even come out due to scheduling conflicts. Had to wait almost a month in regards to a new diagnosis due to a scheduling scheduling conflict. Surgery was on schedule for 3rd week of August 2024. Surgery took almost 3 days to complete. Surgery didn: 1) remove the bad blood vessels and 2) remove the bad cholesterol from my blood. Surgery didn’t remove my gallbladder at this time becuase the bad blood vessels were still not removed. Surgery didn’t remove my heart, kidney or liver at this time either because my"
Positief,"If i could give one star, I would because of my family's experience at The hospital. My younger brother was admitted one day after he was admitted for a pulmonary infection. After being admitted he needed blood work and fluids from multiple locations. While in the hospital his tests showed no change in his condition. The hospital took another look at him and decided he was fine. At that time I signed for HomeGang Care and submitted for a pre-surgery ultrasound to see how his condition was. After being checked out he was still very good to go. I think those results should be considered a success to help the public hear more about his condition in the near future. Regardless of what results came out, it's not an ounce of salt."
Positief,"If i could give a 5 star to The Hospital i would. Staff was great, everyone seemed sincere, helpful and helpful. They’re not the worst hospitals out of any major. However, I’m here to say say that I’m NOT a CREDIT GOD! The Hospital is not my friend and family hospital. Even after they discharge me they still say i’m not a good student and they say i’m not qualified to make a living. Well, they say i’m not a creeper to be honest and they keep giving me crap grades. And I keep trying to work through the awful computer. It’s frustrating because i know i cant change the service providers and registration"
Negatief,"If i could give the star rating IV to 1 star i absolutely would. Went to check in the evening before bed for a blood test. Went to bed at approximately 8:00 pm and did not receive a result until approximately 9:45 pm was notified of a test result already negative. Noticed a change at approximately 9:45 pm and had to go to the bathroom to find out it had been changed. When notified of the change, the patient was advised a test result had been found negative. No changes were made at that time. Horrible experience. Disappointed in Haden's hospital. Called Haden's for labor and delivery. Was advised she could not deliver until tomorrow morning if she wanted to. They then informed her she would"
Negatief,If i could give a 5 star to the nursing staff i know i would i would because i came across this website and it’s the worst place to die. It’s completely off my backyard and far from my family home. This hospital itself is run almost completely by volunteers.. which i guess is why i came to say I would. Even though once i got to my room i still cant open the door because I have excruciating pain in my chest. Don’t these people treat you well enough.. why bother giving them medication because they make you feel better? The staff here is terrible. Don’t they need to be retrained and trained on how to deal with patients that way? I kept coming across various health
Negatief,"If i could give a 5 star to my doctor i would. Surgery was smooth, the pain was minor, and he did the vital surgery on my shoulder. The only thing wrong with his care staff was laughing all the way to the hospital parking lot after being rude to him on his way to work yesterday. Called the infirmary, told them I cannot come in, told them I have no room, told them to leave, drive me home, and arrange for me to have some catnip on me. Disappointed. Went to bed feeling pretty fine. 2pm and awake 5 stars. Didn't get any fluids from the IV site."
Negatief,"If i could give a 4 star, i know I would. The staff here is terrible. They are very unprofessional and rude. I was admitted for a traumatic brain injury and am currently experiencing great pain in my arm. I want my child to be able to walk and do something without pain. My son is 3 and has been in the hospital for over a year. The doctor i speak to after my visit says that will allow him to walk and do the daily exercises like run, do a full ab ab house, walk 2 and half ab house, run 45 minutes, then come back and stay the whole time without issue. Ridiculous procedure. I highly recommended the hospital."
Positief,This hospital starves their patients and staff and needs additional help. They will not do their due diligence and rely on nurses and doctors to effectively care for them.’takers lie and rely on the hospitals judgement when it comes to care for their patients.’takers deceive and disregard patient. Patients and staff deserve better than this.
Negatief,"This hospital starves their patients and staff more often than any other hospital and that is why I called (5) times in the past week to make sure my patient was well enough to return home from a work assignment. I kept getting called back and forth between the various floors of 20 and 50 calling the wrong number, trying to find a doctor to perform a single operation, and not having anyone to call to deliver a paper work paper. The staff here is so bad it almost goes to the hospital bed. Terrible communication from 1 to 5 of them. My 5 year old is at this facility and at 3 months they should order IV bags for her bath and then prep the IV lines to allow the water more room to run. Disgusting"
Negatief,This hospital starves their patients. My wife has epilepsy but never experienced any of the other hospitals epilepsy. Came to this hospital after my wife came to live with them for a medical procedure. The Health care staff seemed really rude and forgetful. Came in to find out my wife has epilepsy and has to be kept in a wheelchair. No one told her we could stay on our own. No one gave her the money because she agreed not to. I am calling on 1000 People to come forward now to say they caught them and are taking action against them. I don't understand why this is the first time I've come forward. It sends a huge bad message that I want this hospital to stop this sick behavior that results in patients with epilepsy being
Positief,"This hospital starves their patients to the point where they are incapable of caring for them for 24 hours a day. They do this when a loved one transfers, for example, they are on a journey to get checked out and then are not seen for weeks. This does a disservice to the people who rely on us for health information such as addresses, social security numbers etc. Once again, we are told that we are there to assist them but here again we are told that we cannot tell them what service we are giving them and that we are doing our best as assistants to help them. Very disappointing. Only hope we are able to find a way to get people to care quicker so that they can care for themselves instead of being moved around the"
Negatief,"This hospital starves their patients. Nurses dont care that they dont have time to be busy getting their discharge papers ready. Staff never even bothered to ask questions at the office. Nurses dont care about their families medical information. Nurses dont care about patients safety or health, they care about profit margins while gouging patients out. Nursing staff is a joke to them and they should be ashamed of themselves."
Positief,This hospital starves their patients so harshly they stay awake for hours without breath blood pressure tests. Nurses are rude to patients and lie through their patients mouth giving patients information that does not match what they say. Patients are told they need medication to help them but instead of trying to go to the pharmacy they wait over a dozen hours to get medication they were promised and received. Patients are told it's because they're on medication to treat a medical issue and lie about it being a medication they know they are on. Patients are pressured to sign paperwork to obtain medication while they wait over a dozen hours for it. Patients are even pressured to have their own doctor to step in and say why they didn't see them before so that he can make a diagnosis
Negatief,Zero stars is more like it. I went to The hospital 2 times and never got in the door. Hospital staff was absolutely horrible! Nurse starves you!!! The only room I went in was on the bedside table and they never even let me in the shower. All the nurses I talked to never even bothered asking me questions such as why I was having such a bad day and why I wasn't taking medication. The whole room is made of crap The staff here is preposterous and needs to be fixed!
Negatief,Zero stars is more like it is denied. I visited a The Hospital and they refused to let me have my test results even after several requests. They refuse to even let me download my results once I give them to them. I have already made a point of telling The Hospital they will not let me download my results until I give them to them. I also don't understand why they waited over 4 hours from Tuesday morning to let me know. I know for sure they waited over an hour for my results to come. After 3 hours of waiting they finally let me know they don't care and let me download them. Ridiculous! Shame on them
Positief,"Zero stars is more like it. We had a receptionist for a medical purpose at our hospital and we politely asked her if she was comfortable taking pictures. She didn’t. Well done! The rest of the staff on the other end were so polite they agreed. After a long delay we finally got a call from Janine allowing us to have a look at her. I don’t know why you would put such a large amount of time and money into a joke. Someone who just happens to know how to take care of their patients need to have a heart rate monitor and a blood pressure monitoring. In my opinion, it made a huge difference in the situation."
Negatief,"Zero stars is more like it. I went to The Hospital for a chest Xray on Tuesday morning and got called back Friday morning after being stopped at an oncoming train for a problem. They called and asked me if I wanted to leave because my pulse rate was dropping and blood pressure was going up. I insisted upon first aid and they waited over an hour. I waited over an hour for my pulse to come out or my blood pressure to go up. Then they called and waited over an hour for my discharge paperwork to come out. I waited over an hour for the nurses to come in to talk to me and they waited over an hour for my discharge results to come out. After an hour, the line for discharge didn’t open"
Positief,Zero stars is more a way of getting attention than anything else. Not only does it give a good feel for your location while you are out of the city but when you return home it conveys that you are comfortable knowing you're not in the wrong. It also means that you'll be able to leave without fear of arrest or even seizure if you so choose.
Negatief,Zero stars is more like going to a hospital and getting the flu shots taken just before surgery. Nurses don't care about you. They care about appearance and reputation so far. They treat you like crap. You are seen as nothing more than a joke and treated like crap every step of the way. Even after I came out of it a week later the nurse calling me a 'pussy' after I refused to stop being a doctor was shocking me to my core. This is the worst treatment i've ever had at this hospital. Ridiculous medicine. Disgusting how someone treated me like this. Disgusting how they treat me when i come out of it 24 hrs later. And then just lie about being into a job.
Negatief,Well they were almost completely abattoir (it was awful) with no toilet facilities and a closed door waitlist of over a dozen people that were never admitted!! Was told to wait 20 mins and have shower a few mins later. Didn't even bother to check my room. Unorganized and rude people
Negatief,"Well they were almost as bad as they came, they made me feel disorganized and tired. They even said I had to leave once my shift ended and go find an additional shift. Even after multiple supervisors signed off on my case for me to return home after 24 hrs they said they would not help me unless I paid for the additional two nights stay. Never once did they issue a discharge."
Negatief,"Well they were almost completely out of the way in my initial registration drive and did not answer multiple calls during my 12 hours shift at 1:30 pm CST - less than an hour after I first registered on January 20, 2024. No one answered the first two calls. After being repeatedly told they would do a thorough job, I submitted my paperwork and waited over an hour for an operator's call. The only thing that stopped me from having my registration canceled was when my supervisor told me that I would have to wait over an hour for a scheduled EI testing at the hospital, only to be told that I cannot wait over an hour because of scheduling conflicts. I would highly recommended the hospital. -Jim"
Negatief,"Well they were almost on the whole rude. The nurse came in for one patient who asked for a bladder clean, the other asked for a refill when they were halfway through the refill, no refill at all. They ended up leaving the patient with soiled underwear, stained snacks, empty hospital room notes, notes with difficult to read things and notes that didn't seem to say anything at all. The whole thing is beyond disgusting."
Negatief,Well they were almost too busy. I just went in to have my lunch and the supervisor comes in the morning and says they've got something bad to say.. Then I have to be patient for 20mins waiting for someone to deliver the news.. wait over an hour!!! Then they do a full autopsy and say they found a kidney abnormality! Then the employee has to step in to arrange my food and drinks and they have my EKG results on the table instead of my own! Very concerning! After one hour is all I have left of my evening shift.
Negatief,"Well they were almost completely unorganized. The manager for the hospital said there were problems and they had to be retrained to deal with the situation. The manager for the hospital said they had to be ready to answer any questions that came in. When asked if there were any problems with the whole procedure, the employee who was supposed to be answering the questions during the whole thing, repeatedly said there were no such problems."
Negatief,It was my first time here. I arrived at 5:30 in the morning from my wife's room. 9:00 is the worst time of the month. Nursing staff is horrible. I walked for almost 20 minutes as someone coming in for a bloodwork was asking me for photos. I told her I do not want to have to have to take photos of me as I am in pain from the heavy heavy daily labor. They started asking for pics since I am very dehydrated. I never once again called for any questions other than my wife asking if she can help. They also yelled at me not to leave if I say don't go. I left after 10 x 10 sat for 20 minutes when they finally finally came. I know some
Positief,"It was my first time taking part in this year's Winter Park Winter Park Winter Park Winter Park at the The Hyatt The Hyatt. The Winter Park was the 3rd in line for the 2005 Winter Olympics. Park was an excellent facility to be had in a hurry in less than an hour. Winter Park is the least traveled location in the park. The only thing worse than Winter Park is The Hospital. Winter Park is worst at Winter Park because the staff there is more like 2nd or 3rd class..poor communication skills and not enough patient attention to the process. And Winter Park is a joke to say the least. Winter Park is more like a ghost town, with no signage and no nurses available. It’s not like it"
Neutraal,"It was my first time doing the surgery at the hospital. After being admitted, it was difficult and stressful as I sat in a waiting room all day. I was infested with soot and was never given fluids. Once I was given a medicine plate and a IV in my hand, my symptoms abated. After three hours of being intubated I was completely fine. The only nasty thing I had was a swollen starched place across my nose and there was no IV in my hand. My’s doctor told me to keep going and it would take at least a week at least to get a clear picture of me. Once that was done he gave me a 50% rest and instructed me to take a biopsy again on Tuesday"
Positief,"It was my first time taking part in this year's competition, and I loved getting to know each and every one of the personnel. After two hours or more of waiting on line I was finally greeted with open arms and led out. After being directed to several locations, the procedure was the same as a year ago. I'll be leaving open the possibility of doing a repeat operation, since I am extremely fatigued after almost two hours. (I'm probably the worst. Only reason I kept going was to wait for someone to come say I'm pretty good at my job…). They even made a point of asking for a medical waiver before doing so. The whole thing was kind of overkill. The only thing I wish I could have been"
Positief,It was my first time at the hospital and they were extremely helpful. Nurses were very nice though and did a wonderful job helping me. I’m very disappointed with the way the medical staff at the hospital handled me. Very frustrating and disheartening when it came to’s experience.
Negatief,It was my first time going to this hospital. My wife was admitted a few days ago and has been in ICU for less than 24 hours. They stopped short of calling for an ambulance as the situation was getting out of hand. I'm not sure why they didn't call for an ambulance as several times they called were distracted and didn't care. Nurses are usually more helpful in the evening time so why not call for a friend or family member instead of a staff member? The staff member who questions you is supposed to step away from you and walk for 20 minutes until someone comes forward to finally get back to you with a paper trail showing he or she was ok. Had no drink or drugs on the patient at the time. No visible
Positief,"This place is a joke, I am an atheist myself, so moved into the 2nd floor room at midnight. I was there for 2 medical tests, one was pre-operation, anesthesia, pre-surgery, 1 was post-operation. No one came in until the door was almost completely closed. The manager came in after seeing me for a clean bill of health. Came in for the EKG, I knew nothing of the various tests I had to have except for an ultrasound, it was supposed to show my kidney function was normal, was completely unharmed. Came in for blood work after being stopped for a blood test, nothing happened, came in for x-ray, nothing. Went into bathroom then checked in"
Negatief,"This place is a joke. They are rude, unappreciative, and rude to the point of almost giving way (poorly performed) to a grateful patient. The food is horrible and bland.. bad food, but not by far the worst I have ever had to go to. The place is horrible. The manager came in for 4 minutes went in 2mins left, showed up at 3 mins, told him to get some coffee and some food he didn't want, refused his refill and walked away. After he gave him his meds the room was completely empty. Only old people sitting around waiting for the bad food to arrive. Horrible attitude from the manager to just walk away with nothing. After a 5 minute stay they just told"
Negatief,"This place is a terrible place! Came in for the morning shift from a job I was about to have but instead of getting into my car, I had to get out and meet this hospice nurse for an ultrasound. Went in for the taillight and only had a few questions. Not a nurse! The staff was kind but not helpful. Then the nurse came for the ultrasound and came in for the taillight. I told her the problem and she proceeded to try to find some sort of cardiac monitoring but no one came. Was told I had to follow up with the hospice nurse who was assigned the assignment to make a diagnosis. Nurse wasn't helpful. Unprofessional. Went to the bathroom and asked for a nurse. Didn�"
Negatief,This place is a nightmare. I came in here to get my valet checked out and a xray not performed due to heavy chest pain. I was shocked and really disappointed with how I was treated. The doctor recommended I stay for 2 days and this is what I came out with. Came in today for the EKG exam and was toldI was not qualified. EKG tests are very nice here and I am NOT impressed with the way this place is set up. Staff was extremely nice. I had the gallbladder removed and ISTR sewn a wound to the x-ray. Came in for xray and still don't know what's wrong. Called and they can do nothing. Called and they can't even
Negatief,This place is a joke. I came in because my dad missed the surgery and my stepson was in the ICU. I needed kidney transplantation and my dad didn’t have the time or inclination to transport his child to this location due to scheduling conflicts. My stepson was moved to the 12th floor and my stepson is in the ICU right now right across the street. The manager should do more tests. If they find anything wrong give the operator until they can. The manager should be fired.
Positief,"This place is a complete nightmare. I went there after being advised it would be closed for a medical issue. After being assured the hospital would allow me into their building, I had to wait over an hour for a nurse to arrive. I asked for one hour leave to come and they left me waiting for an hour or two. I left without having a care call scheduled for me to make after 10pm. After being promised food and fluids, I was delivered a shocking lie when in fact I was delivered an entire 12 hours. After being directed to the Hospital's website the nurses didn’t return my call until 10pm the next morning. All in all a complete and utter lie."
Negatief,The care received from the nursing assistants was wonderful. The only thing that could be improved was the scheduling of discharge. Once discharge day came around I decided to go to my tech friend who was in IEMA the day before I left I got so moved I had to be there for 2 hrs I had to be there for 48 hrs the 3rd floor waiters were so rude to me. Discharge was a joke I guess but I am so tired of waiting this long I still refuse to go to this hospital
Positief,"The care received from the hospital at this time’s unsatisfactory’took more than 20 minutes to process my questions and was unavailable for additional services, such as IV bags or catheters, needed to be taken care of’taker attempted to remove a dent in my face and torso, while trying to treat a minor infraction. The man who performed the surgery’s surgery did not return calls for additional information from The hospital regarding this issue."
Positief,"The care received from the hospice department which was excellent’t of the 1st day in 4 visits’s since my discharge’s description at the hospital,""They’re gonna take a beating at this hospital""!"
Negatief,"The care received from the hospital’s neuropsych and traumatic discharges unit regarding a patient’s breathing, pulse rate, and blood pressure were average and timely. The hospital does not allow patients to leave until they are required to and have the requested information. Hospital staff were extremely rude, unprofessional, and did not care for the patient’s well being."
Positief,"The care received from the hospital was good, they did a poor job of caring for their patients and staff, which left me unsatisfied with my care after two visits. As a pharmacist myself, I understand that my time at the hospital means a lot, but how can I make a living by working 10 hours a day, 3 days a week? At $5 an hour I really don't know."
Positief,"The care received from the nursing home is excellent. Nurses are compassionate, helpful and helpful. They are not rude and they never take pride in their job. As far as the hospital goes the way of the dodo, they make a mockery of the medical services and do their rounds in the infirmary hoping to find something to eat or drink. The hospital does not have a parking garage and can be extremely congested. I highly recommended the Better Business Bureau to visit."
Positief,"On discharge the nurses came to The Hospital with large black swabs of red and white emergency room #1 stars. I had a good go at it and am incredibly grateful. They kept calling for more nurse visits and testing, after which, I couldn’t find them. The nurse I went to for the AED discharge was another awesome nurse. She was phenomenal! Her care was beyond belief. She even went on my list of wish fulfillment centers to check on me every 4 pm. Highly recommend The Hospital."
Positief,"On discharge the nurses were incredibly busy trying to bring me food and water. The Doctor seemed very pleased with how the nurses answered all my questions. It is very disheartening hearing these nurses say things that don't quite cut it to making you feel comfortable. I understand that I may not be the best nurse in the hospital, but if there is one thing that I can rely on then it is compassion from the doctors. I guess that is why I called for an extra nurse for the night."
Positief,On discharge the nurses took great care of me. They made me feel comfortable and took great care of me. Everyone seemed to know me very well and cared about me. I am very grateful for all the great doctors that came to my rescue. Thank you for all that you do.
Positief,"On discharge the nurses called 3 times for help. The nurse and I could tell she was quite nervous. She shook my hand and whispered in my ear that she was ok. It was 12 pm and I was OK. Then a follow-up EEG confirmed that I had a high-fiber, high-protein diet. Of all the diet recommendations I made I was the least florida-restrictive. Of all the doctors, all three of them were positive. Of the 3 doctors in particular, none were more impressed than myself. None of the other nursing staff felt pressured by the patient. Just kind of enjoyed being here. I guess it means a lot to me."
Positief,"On discharge the nurses were polite, compassionate, and clear-shod. The Doctor was especially impressed by the teamwork displayed by nurse Ethel and staff during her stay in hospital. In addition to the physical therapists and the rest of the healthcare team, the physical therapists were as accommodating and thorough as hospital administrators."
Negatief,On discharge the nurses seemed a little rushed. Some of the nurses came in so fast it scared the kids and the rest of the staff didn't know what was going on. I don't know how many they were. I think a whole team was on the 12th floor doing the waiting room procedure.

Positief,"This review is to give you an idea of what I could have been better prepared to do. For the month of just over 12-15 December, I had a beautiful beautiful clean, young, beautiful baby. I had her deliver to live with me at The Hospital as soon as I could with her health insurance. She was amazing! I had her assigned Nurse Practitioner each Tuesday, Thursday and Friday for 2 hours and she led by example by showing great care to my babies. I couldn’t have been happier with the labor and delivery team. The nurses and doctors really listened and listened to what I was experiencing as I was being cared for. They listened and listened to what I had to say on the phone with my doctors. The"
Positief,"This review is to briefly review the nursing and allied staff that I have encountered at The Hospital, which are highly regarded and trusted in my physical condition. I must say that the entire staff is top notch. From the nurse to the surgical assistants who accompany you through the surgical and recovery process, the entire staff performs their jobs extremely well. Considering every detail of the RNAs visit, from detailed post office visits, to the room lighting, to your Doctor list, I highly recommend visiting The Hospital. If you are going to anyone else's medical needs, then this facility is the place to be. I have had excellent care from The Hospital for nearly a decade and can’t speak highly enough of what they have done during that time. I also"
Positief,"This review is to sum- up my experience of each clinic. I have had so many wonderful doctors that I have allowed them to change my life. Their appointments have been fantastic. Each one has been very direct and informative. They listened to my medical needs and provided the best care possible. They listened, visited, and answered your questions. I trust my health to them the entire way. Thank you!!!!"
Positief,"This review is to give you a quick overview of the components within the system. These are the Best, but the One that really stood out to me was the Homeostasis. It was the only rating I have ever given it. When I got home and took a look at it, I would never have thought of the need for such an extremely sensitive thing. It is truly remarkable that a facility like this can truly offer services to all of us that cannot afford them. The staff was incredibly thoughtful, encouraging and informative. I also wish I could speak more frankly about the Doctor. It took me a little while to get used to his tone of voice and his very clear instructions to the patients. But by far the most remarkable thing about this facility"
Positief,"This review is to explain the procedure for transplanting a patient into the ICU. The transplantation was stopped ten days ago due to lack of bloodwork. I don’t recommend any healthcare professional to transplant an ICU patient into this body! The surgeons and nurses in the ICU were wonderful. They were very thoughtful, compassionate and helpful throughout this entire process. The transplant team, medical staff, and the doctors and nurses were amazing. I recommend all hospitals to do the transplantation, even the one called Home. The transplant team"
Positief,"After contending with their insurance for months, Dr. Lin was able to get an informed decision. The procedure was relatively quick and the doctors we spoke with seemed confident in their opinion."
Positief,"After contending with their insurance understaffing for several months, Matt and his girlfriend decided to give Inpatient and follow Mother nature with a change of heart. Today, they are able to service both the patient and the staff with ease. The hospital also houses a 24 hr reception desk and a large recovery room for those recovering from traumatic events. Matt and his girlfriend are extremely grateful to the Inpatient Neurosurgeon team for the thorough neurosurgery and post op care."
Positief,"After contending with their labor situation before. There was also the time Doctor went to The Hospital to tell me that she had been fired. I have since been there. Both the nurses and therapists there have been great. Doctor is always encouraging, kind and sympathetic. Her care has led me to make room for a more secure hospital. The doctors, however, are not always in every hospital. They tend to be more engaged with the people in the room and tend to over-interpret what is said."
Positief,"After contending with their legal team for months now, I decided to change my mind and sue, instead of waiting for a hospital that treats me to finalize my medical history and ensure it is consistent with their procedures. A full 12 appointments are made daily, with each doctor assigning a coordinator. The care each nurse and doctor takes is absolutely fantastic. The doctor who meds me leads by example, making sure my condition is taken care of as best as I can. I would definitely recommend The Hospital."
Positief,"After contending with their insurance, the hospital wound recovery team recommended the Advanced Recovery Surgery team, which I was enthralled with. Their team was thoughtful and professional and I highly recommend them. It took an extra day or two before my ICU was ready, as I had a very difficult case of Candida (a very heavy condition) in my right arm. I recently had my own emergency room, and all the recovery was smooth sailing. I'm very impressed by Advanced Recovery Surgery and they are making a difference for all patients. Definitely recommend The Hospital for all of your healthcare needs."
Positief,"After contending with their medical team for hours after surgery, the hospital did what any other hospital would do in this situation; they called the nursing department to give an explanation as to why the procedures were not being done as planned. As their nurse seemed to understand the situation, I felt confident in my care. My Doctor took great care of me throughout the whole process - he was extremely helpful, compassionate, and informative throughout the whole process. Thank you, The Hospital for taking care of your well being!!"
Positief,"My son was in the hospital for 5 days and died in the morning due to a heart attack. I can’t remember the first time in my entire life that a staff member was so happy to have me, especially considering all the stress I felt every single day. Every nurse was amazing and everyone was so kind, encouraging, and compassionate. If only I could have more energy."
Negatief,My son was in the ICU for 11 days and he died. My oldest son got admitted in December and there were many calls for removal. I asked my oldest if she could feel any pain or anything. She could feel nothing. Only someone to comfort her.
Positief,My son was in ICU and his breathing was wonderful and we didn't have any complications. He wasn't very bright or seemed very bright bright. I called the hospital and they were quite nice. I had an all clear and he was received very well. The night nursing was excellent as well. Dr. Ring did an excellent job.
Positief,"My son was in a coma for 5 days and recovered extremely well. He was given antibiotics, PET scans and other supportive care in ICU. Doctor Baxley and his team of nurses and doctors are amazing. The team of neurosurgeons and ersatz nurses and techs on site are top notch. I highly recommend The Hospital."
Positief,My son was in critical condition at The Hospital. The Doctor arrived within an hour and said that we would need an additional nurse to come in. She called back the following Friday morning and had us brought in. We were informed that our son has been OK for the week and that he is OK. The Doctor was able to give us some comforting information regarding the week and that helped us tremendously. It seemed that each and every nurse coming in needed attention and was treated with respect. Thank you to everyone at The Hospital!
Positief,"My son was in the ICU for 4 days and died 3 days later. We received this kind of emotional care every day. Everyone was so kind, caring, and patient that they took time to find their son. I am thankful that I have God right here to rely on him for everything that I need."
Positief,"Such an exceptional experience. I had a great, happy, and healthy baby. The nurse on the other hand didn’t get very clear answers as to her questions, so I left feeling unsatisfied. I was quite emotional and felt sad after trying so hard to save the life of my own mom. In my time there have been many wonderful caregivers, like Doctor, RN, nurse, and other such wonderful people who have allowed me to be cared for and treated with such dignity and compassion. These people truly care about my well being and I will’t be stopping anyone from doing so. Thank you all so much for caring."
Positief,Such an exceptional experience. I highly recommend The Hospital.
Positief,"Such an exceptional experience. They were all very thoughtful and helpful. I had one patient who was almost admitted five months ago and did very well. It was May 8th and I was given antibiotics. I had a team of physical therapists, 3 EEG and MRIs teaming with the RNLI Neurosurgeon. It took until Tuesday morning to come out and it was very clear what was going on there. When we arrived at 8:30 we had 12 opossums and no opossums on us. Then things got really rough for a while. For some reason, our EEG was not working and the EEG was off very quick. Today since then I can finally see my right eye. The doctors were great, helpful, and kind."
Positief,Such an exceptional experience. Thankyou everyone who came in and out on a Friday and made us feel welcomed. So happy to be a part of this family. You are the most incredible person i have ever met and i wish i could give more information about you. Thank you my GOD Jessica!!!!!!!!! I have been to a hospital many times and you have the best care. You are like a mother to me and i will forever be a part of this family. I will forever be a part of you!!!!!!!!!
Positief,Such an exceptional experience. Would highly recommend.
Positief,"Such an exceptional experience. Words can’t express the level of professionalism and attention to detail provided to each of the healthcare workers. They made me feel confident and listened carefully to. The Doctor was always helpful, sympathetic, and understanding as he explained the issue. As I understand it, they only recently switched to something totally different and it actually led to more negative results."
Positief,"Doctor is a wonderful Doctor. The Doctor cares about his patients as much as anyone. I like that he calls the shots. I can’t remember the final name properly, but I must say that I respect him and wish him very much the best."
Positief,Doctor is a wonderful person and she adores the Hospital. I would love to see a Doctor doing a transplant on my behalf.
Positief,Doctor is a wonderful nurse and tech. My husband and I needed a little extra care and attention during his 4th month at The Hospital. I think he needs these extra legs to warm up his stomach during postpartum labor. They're great! Would definitely recommend this facility!
Positief,Doctor is a wonderful Doctor Who listens with genuine concern and listens and answers any and all questions you may have. Every single person I have talked to is extraordinary! Doctor Who truly is the best medicine.
Positief,Doctor is a wonderful Doctor. I would highly recommend him to any of my care team members.
Positief,Doctor is a wonderful Doctor and I will recommend his services and good care to all members of his patient group. I will be doing my best to ensure his well-being is improved. I must say that this entire experience has been a blessing for me and I am very grateful for the opportunity to do business with him. Thank you so much for taking the difficult decision of accepting my husband into your care. God bless him with peace of mind and peace of mind
Positief,"Amazing hospital and staff were very thoughtful, helpful, and polite. I would highly recommend them to anyone considering a recovery."
Positief,"Amazing hospital and staff amazing!!!!! I had a fantastic stay at The Hospital!!!! Had the best care and support staff I have ever had!!!!! The doctors, nurses and meds were AMAZING!!!! Highly recommended this hospital!!!!! Highly recommend they!"
Positief,"Amazing hospital and staff were so kind, attentive and helpful. Their calls and answers were always positive, encouraging, transparent and informative. I had an awesome stay and thank you to the entire staff for making a difference."
Positief,"Amazing hospital and staff. The patients were fantastic!!! I'd received care there multiple times before and each time was different! Drs. were highly critical, kind & compassionate. Each supervisor stayed with me for multiple appointments throughout the evening to ensure I was getting the best care possible. The facility also allows a nurse to take the calls for you. I highly recommend it!"
Positief,Amazing hospital and staff were amazing! My husband needed 12 hours of travel to get our donor kidney broken out. He was kept very warm and took very good care of. The doctors and nurses always seemed genuine. I would highly recommend The Hospital!
Positief,"Amazing hospital and staff I have had have been very pleased with them. Doctor X has been very helpful throughout the process, from his team of assistants to Dr O'Loughlin to my recovery team Nurse Practitioner and recovery team techs. My husband had a wonderful recovery and is very grateful for Martin Dr O'Neill's amazing medical expertise and services. In addition to his incredible care he takes from the emergency room medline, where he draws the line between good and ill. Dr O'Neill has consistently provided top notch care with appointments, follow-ups and scheduling expert therapy."
Positief,"I been to many hospitals, none where have ever satisfied me more and moreso than at The Hospital. From the resident nurse in the morning shift nursing the patient to the robotic assist nurse the rest of the staff to Dr. Ramirez there is not a single infirm or critical issue that can be addressed by any means other than by calling for meds or by calling for your care within an hour of being received. Thank you for making such a great facility possible. I would like to come to you personally and talk about my experience with each of the doctors, nurses and staff on your journey to healing. I feel honored to be a patient of your care and it truly humbles me to have you as my patient."
Positief,"I been to many hospitals, none have ever before broken my heart. Only one that has ever had the gall to issue an emergency room card was called in for the operation and I can say the doctors and nurses were AMAZING!!! Their care always took a little getting used to, however, they kept us informed as to if anything was amiss. Today, I've been to over 1000 of these & they are AMAZING!! They always make you feel safe, secure, & comfortable feeling confident in your heart hospital room stay!!!! Highly recommend them!!!"
Positief,"I been to many hospitals and have been impressed with the quality of care they offer. I highly recommended The Hospital. The team behind these nurses, PA, Mandy and Cathy are top notch. I highly recommend The Hospital."
Positief,"I been to many hospitals. None have made me feel comfortable or confident enough to post a positive review as I have spent the past week and a half in each. None of the doctors, nurses or other staff have been kind, encouraging or informative to my well-being throughout this trip. None of the patients I meet are happy about nor happy about the situation. None of the diagnosis and treatment is prompt -- even if it seems like a good idea. I have had so many providers that the level of care has never been anywhere near what it is in the current system. When I tell them all -- including myself -- that I am sick or feeling good, they all give me questions or complaints. Some of these questions boil down to two words:"
Positief,"I been to many hospitals, no less. I have seen excellent care and the staff I have been to has been beyond amazing. Everyone on the team is so amazing taking their time with me. Thank you so much to my wonderful fiance for taking her time with me last night!"
Positief,"I been to many hospitals and none have ever provided more love, respect and kindness than I do at Heartland Presbyterian Hospital. I cannot express the gratitude and kind words of empathy I have received from all of the staff and patients I have visited. If your heart is in recovery, follow us on Twitter and share this post with everyone you meet. Every visit, every detail of care, teamwork and compassion is always memorable. For those of you in need, kindness, friendship, safety, comfort, comfort of mind, and reassurance that your well being is safe, secure, and secure each and every day is priceless. For those who are grieving over the loss of a loved one, or the difficult times ahead in your life, or feeling neglected,"
Positief,"This was my second time here, and I was quite pleased. The food went fast enough to make me feel comfortable and secure during the whole visit, and the service was prompt. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend The Hospital."
Positief,"This was my second time in my hospital. My husband was extremely ill and we had no idea what was wrong with him until he woke up the next morning. I was so happy we got him some food and fluids. It was good to be home free for a little while. Otherwise, I thought it might be a problem with the ER putting away the heavy items such as diapers and wipes. They really didn't do anything to make him feel very well after 11am and 3 pm. Everyone seemed happy, thoughtful, and taking care of business. I'd like to see more high risk areas like ERs be more patient with patients."
Neutraal,This was my second time at this hospital
Positief,"This was my second time at this hospital. My fiance was excellent, stayed very long and my youngest son was born a day and half late."
Positief,"This was my second time here and I love all the staff. They are all very warm, thoughtful and professional people that speak your language in a clear, professional tone. I highly accomodate these people with my health so far and am very grateful."
Negatief,"This was my second time in so much as a hospital, and I couldn't say enough good things about the services the staff provided. They were extremely attentive, had a good team of nurses and if anything, went over their level being rude. It took me 3 shifts in there and they took 11 or 12 calls for an error. The floor was rickety before that, and I couldn't find any information about the service they provided."
Positief,"I had a fabulous experience. From head nurse to nurse to Doctor all I can say is very happy with the care given. I had kidney transplant and recovery, and recovery is well above replacement level. Thank you all very much"
Positief,I had a fabulous experience. The healthcare team at The Hospital were AMAZING. The Surgery team was top notch as well. The Doctor took time to explain things and really explained all of the details. Thank you all very much
Positief,"I had a fabulous experience. My husband is from New Jersey who lives in Florida and has multiple sclerosis. The Doctor and I both have The Hospital. Both of us were very confident, helpful and sensitive. I am extremely grateful. Would highly recommended. Sarah"
Positief,"I had a fabulous experience. I had the wonderful care of neurosurgeon Dr. Orlando Ephraim who I had come to love during my recovery from a stroke. During my 12 months away from The Hospital I received over 1000% more patient services than I would have received anywhere else in the world. From nurses and doctors to PA personnel, staff members to the surgical team, PA interns, and even doctors and nurses, I truly felt safe and confident being here. I would highly recommend Dr. Orlando Ephraim, and his team of neurosurgeons."
Positief,"I had a fabulous experience. My fiance and I held hands and showed some great attention to detail as we walked through the facility. The nurse was great as well, helping us understand every detail of the pregnancy and nursing team."
Positief,"I had a fabulous experience with The Hospital. From the nurses and staff, all the doctors, nurses and staff to the nurses and staff at the hospital. I highly recommend The Hospital. The staff and patients give them so much time and attention. Thank you for the excellent care."
Positief,I recently had an MRI done and were in good enough shape to be admitted to a number of hospitals. The Doctor was so helpful and informative during my stay that I decided to give my husband the robotic hearing aid in the morning. It took more than 10 minutes from registration to being confirmed as hearing aid in the morning.
Positief,"I recently had an awesome experience with a very large group of coworkers. It was absolutely incredible being a companion. These 12 seemed a little rushed at first, but over the next 12 each of us received so much attention that we couldn't allow it to overshadow the amazing experience."
Positief,"I recently had an MRI, I had a procedure done involving them entrapping the the tendons. The post op op procedure made the removal of the tendons a little more complicated. I was happy with the results as I had a good recovery. I was cautious and had my patients pre op if needed."
Neutraal,"I recently had an opiate attack. From the hospital I was hooked. They took forever to explain what was going on with my opiate problems. None of the nurses and Technicians seemed to care. And the old hospital staff couldn’t really explain the difference in staff. I wish I could have answered all of your questions, but I can’t. It’s like an endless battle."
Positief,"I recently had an MRI procedure with a large pre-op redness that required pre-op robotic hip replacement. The robotic hip replacement surgery went well and I am grateful to my donor, Avanta Neurosurgery for taking time to review the results. For those of you who need additional information, please visit www.psychotics4u.org"
Positief,"I recently had an ORANGE surgery. My recovery was smooth and I feel great! The operating team was fantastic! Every doctor, nurse, and tech was so helpful AND professional. I felt confident, secure, and informed throughout the experience. Thank you for all the wonderful care you give to patients and families."
Positief,My husband recently had a kidney transplant at The Hospital. Thanks so much to all our awesome nurses and techs for being as accommodating as possible. I can't wait to get to work next May!
Positief,"My husband recently had a procedure on his 12th birthday. We didn't know it was going to last, we just thought some kind of traumatic experience like that might be helpful. Once we got to the operating room, both our surgeons and I were moved quickly. Doctor Alexander had me very supportive as we moved through the long list of blood draws. A beautiful view of the lake. Doctor Chikun did his best to answer our medical needs. They didn't always come quick, however, and our procedure leader, Dr Karen, was great. Sarah, our nursing assistant and I arrived more than two hours late. The doctor, Doctor Chikun, and nurse Aree had a very calming calming experience. I highly recommended The Hospital. The"
Positief,My husband recently had another heart attack that had a long recovery. He is fantastic Doctor and the doctors and staff at HeartFreedom team are AMAZING. Everyone from nurses to therapists and if need be calmed down. Everyone was so friendly and kind and helpful. Not to mention that Jessica seemed to care for her husband very well and took him to multiple locations throughout the hospital. Every single person in the room was so kind and caring. Every nurse and doctor were as accommodating as they could be. I do recommend The HeartFreedom Institute for anyone considering seeking more health services or to stay within walking distance of a hospital. The center is also underutilized though I have been there and it is ok. The staff at HeartFreedom Institute is top notch.
Positief,"My husband recently had kidney surgery. It was one of those rare rare inter-op surgeries where surgeons come in and take our transplant plans. I couldn't be more emotional the entire way through. My husband was fine, went to The Hospital, received all his transplant requests within 6 days and found recovery absolutely incredible. The food was delicious, the medications were always within easy half an hour, and the doctors always made me feel confident and happy. They did such a wonderful job putting pressure on my body during the process. Thank you again for the great service from your surgeon."
Positief,"My husband recently had a kidney transplant at The Hospital. The surgeon and the transplant team were the best. He and his team of doctors, radiology, allied dissectionists and surgeons all went above and beyond to make this a success. I will forever be grateful for the quality care the Transplant Institute provides. Thank you to My husband recently had a kidney transplant at The Hospital.

Positief,"My husband recently had a kidney transplant at the Transplant Center from The Hospital. We were so impressed with all of the personnel the nurses, doctors, and surgeons brought to this amazing recovery. We couldn’t have asked for more. Thank you all for your amazing care and support."
Positief,The surgical center has one of the best team doctors in the entire state of Florida and I highly recommend them. I have had The Hospital since November 6th 2005 and they have been consistently top notch ever. The Doctor is The Only Doctor I trust in the entire Florida Hospital!!!!! Thank you so much for the great service from The Hospital!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Positief,The surgical center has many beautiful locations with fantastic staff and are a great representation of Durham. The healthcare team has a wonderful team and is top notch considering the level of care each Doctor receives.
Positief,The surgical center has great doctors and nurses and all staff are very friendly & welcoming. Being on the 8th floor is awesome because as a surgical center this feels very old then. The surgeons and nurse techs that go over there are always welcoming & encouraging to have around. The whole staff is highly regarded and the more that I ask for they give me the better received. Highly recommended to all of my surgical goals!
Positief,The surgical center has a high level of operating staff and highly recommended each member of our team. They are all outstanding! Thank you so much for visiting The Hospital!!!
Positief,"The surgical center has two locations in the heart of South Bend and they all match the procedure, in various states of operation and beyond. I really like each one of the nurse staff. They both offer free transport and comfort during the operation as well as information regarding medications needed. Overall, a great facility with a long history and a high rating from the Heart Failure Institute. Highly recommend this facility."
Positief,"The surgical center has a wonderful staff, and the patients love the care they receive! The Doctor is very sympathetic, encouraging, professional, sensitive and compassionate. There was also one patient who was unsatisfied with his surgical center cardiology appointment during his stay; however, the Doctor is the best Physician!!! He was very prompt with the surgery and provided us with the best medical information! Thank you for visiting The Hospital!"
Positief,I have been to a number of hospitals and none have ever match my experience. I ask if there is anything else that I can do that I can do better than this hospital. I have been to many other hospitals which I have never encountered this way and they all match my experience. I can’t speak highly enough of the staff and care given to me during my stay here at The Hospital. Both Mariah and Michelle are exceptional workers who make life so much easier for us all. Thank you to every single person for their time and prayers during my stay here at The Hospital
Positief,I have been to five hospitals under their care. Each time I have been impressed with the level of care each nurse takes. Every patient deserves the best of care.
Positief,"I have been to a number of hospitals and none have ever match the services you offer. I understand and respect your need for extra care, however you provide such a service you should feel free to call in sick if you have any problems. Even doctors that I've spoken to have come away with the feeling that something is amiss. I recommend The Hospital for those that are in need."
Positief,I have been to many hospitals and the surgical centers. I have had the best care staff and patients at every level. The Hospital is more than happy to answer all your medical questions and answer any questions regarding your condition. Thank you for visiting our hospital!
Positief,"I have been to more than 1,500 hospitals. I have seen The Hospital, The Children's Hospital, The Children's Hospital, The Royal South Korea Hospital, the South Korean Hospital, the Korean Hospital, and many other top notch hospitals. Each of these locations are very beautiful and feature a large family that visits each time. These hospitals are also more upscale compared to other areas of the South. The hospital and staff are exceptional. Every person making and receiving a appointment is treated with respect and concern while being listened to. Each person making and receiving a question is treated with dignity and dignity is priceless. Every person making and receiving a question is greeted with respect and concern while being listened to and listened to. Every single person making and receiving a diagnosis"
Positief,"I have been to lots of hospitals and have seen very good results. My surgeon, RN, and her EMT team are top notch at what they do. I highly recommend them to anyone. My 6 year old son, has been admitted, and his very good ICU team is doing an amazing job. My 6 year old is getting better as he ages and is recovering at a good rate. Thank you to all who have been assigned to follow up with me regarding surgical needs during my stay. I appreciate your kind care and helpful questions. Dr. Mary"
Positief,"This was my first time taking part in a surgery. My surgeon, Dr. Debbie, and I were the first to be admitted, and I felt comfortable doing so. I would like to express my gratitude to all the team and staff that took me through this difficult time. They made a truly beautiful day possible by being truly caring with me during this incredibly difficult time."
Positief,This was my first experience with a person of these kinds of qualities. I couldn't have foreseen such a wonderful experience. Thank you so much to all of the staff for taking the wonderful care of me!
Positief,"This was my first visit to The Hospital as a patient and they were great! The staff was also very kind and provided with all the in-patient information needed. The Doctor is also grateful for his expertise in diagnosing, treating, and providing critical life-sustaining care. The Doctor's expertise as an Advanced Care Technologist, leads one to believe The Hospital is well-equipped to meet the needs of each of our patients. He provided an overall supportive and informative experience. I highly recommend The Hospital."
Positief,"This was my first experience as an RN and was very helpful. I received very little e-mail from the healthcare team, other than one from one nurse saying something rude. I should add that I was reassured by the care of the nursing tech Kristen. Kristen actually explained each step of the procedure, so that I could follow up with my old providers with any knowledge as to what I was getting into during my visit. The techs were great. She even helped me bring my old surgical center plexus in. Thank you all very much for your kind care, and God bless you all."
Positief,"This was my first visit to Doctor. I thought he was very good, however throughout my stay he seemed a little slow to process what I was doing. I was impressed by the care that he received and his knowledge of nursing and allied therapy. I wish I could have foreseen the negative results I would have received in the future. The hospital is beautiful, clean, modern and has an amazing staff."
Positief,"This was my first time seeing The Hospital. My husband, his 1st nurse and his second nurse all came in very impressed with my care. My husband had unexpected hospital stay and stayed with them for 2 nights. They were extremely kind, informative, professional and kind people. I don't have any awards for this but I cannot say enough good things about The Hospital."
Positief,"Everyone we meet are top notch! From the nurses and techs we meet to the full kitchen staff, everyone is always smiling & welcoming. The food is always top notch too!"
Positief,"Everyone we meet are amazing. From the incredibly helpful Dr Pepper to Kristen and Jan, we're extremely impressed with the caring attitude and care that each and every person shows. The food is definitely on par with that of others. It's good to have something free during the week so that everyone can make a difference in the situation. The service is spot on however due to the high tech equipment that is located next to it."
Positief,"Everyone we meet are all experienced with operating small businesses. They are wonderful people with extraordinary skills. For months we have had them on the waiting list for appointments, and they answered every call. To top it off, they were great mentors to our lives. Thank You Thank You."
Positief,"Everyone we meet are great and I feel like a person, not an object. I feel like I'm taking over the entire staff so much. The evening nurse personating the recovery from the attacks was amazing. Cathy and Michelle were both wonderful helpers, who answered my questions and helped me understand what was going on with my recovery. Highly recommend this hospital."
Positief,"Everyone we meet are very engaged and genuine. Everyone is very friendly, helpful and informative. They tell us quite a lot about their lives and goals; however the lack of empathy, negative vibes or respectful attitude they get from their own caregivers means that they're left feeling left behind or disrespected. A tough pill to swallow for some of us. It's like some kind of mental institution for us to watch out for as we navigate our problems. Otherwise, such a great facility!"
Positief,"Everyone we meet are exceptional -- from The Hospital's medical team to our surgical team. When it comes to caring for you the most complicated part is caring for our patients. Taking care of our patients is the top priority. In doing so, we bring our deepest respect for everyone and what it means to us each and every day to help them feel at home. They are the backbone of this organization. In doing so, we give them the comfort and safety of knowing that we understand that our care and appreciation stays with them while they are in recovery."
Positief,"The Doctor and the staff are top notch. As far as food goes, all i can say is good. 5 stars!"
Positief,"The Doctor and the nurses were so positive, they made my pregnancy a little less painful. The procedure was relatively easy, however, it took more than 10 minutes. The following morning, I was greeted warmly by the Doctor and my beautiful pregnancy donor, Ethel. The Doctor and Ethel were able to save a lot of time and anguish."
Positief,"The Doctor and the patient were very friendly. A team member walked the patients very thoughtfully and explained everything very well. In addition, a supervisor seemed very compassionate and kind caring. I also feel that the staff is well prepared and communicate very clearly. I definitely recommend the Hospital."
Positief,The Doctor and the nurses and staff were amazing. I highly recommend Doctor Chiang Mai for making a long time commitment to care for a broken heart patient. The Doctor is compassionate and helpful throughout the whole process. The Doctor and his team have always been so helpful in my recovery journey. I highly recommend Doctor Chiang Mai.
Positief,The Doctor and the nurses and the staff are amazing!! I would definitely recommend them to everyone. The doctors and nurses all went above and beyond to make my life a little easier.
Positief,"The Doctor and the nurses at this hospital are amazing. The Doctor always called me 'Baby Face', and it always felt good to give him a hug. From his comfort and concern for his well being, to his great care at recovery, to all the extra attention and attention to detail the nurses bring to his care, they bring a smile to his face every time. Every staff member compliments him on his good health, and on his amazing recovery. They make this experience more beautiful to see. The Doctor and his staff are wonderful people. Thank you for the great service and good care you receive each time you visit."
Positief,"I like to thank all my wonderful staff for taking my medicine during my stay at The Hospital. I was admitted Jan 8th and stayed a night. The nurses, doctor(!) and I were all very pleased with the health of my life. Every nurse that stood in her way took their time with me. They also knocked on doors and checked on me several times during my stay. The Doctor was Awesome and I will definitely be back to visit more frequently. Thank you again for taking care of me during my stay at The Hospital"
Positief,"I like to thank all of our staff and sponsors for taking the time to take time to explain our medical needs during this difficult time. From Jan 1st to May 2nd, 2012, we received many calls from patients stating that the pain was getting too great or too little for them to deal with. I have seen such care provided throughout my career, and the level of care given to each and every one of you is extraordinary. Every person providing quality medical care is absolutely extraordinary. Everyone from coordinator to reception to supervisor, reception staff, post office receptionist"
Positief,"I like to thank all the staff and the nurses for taking care of my situation in hospital. The surgery was a very good experience. They all took time to explain my situation and explained everything so well. Each shift coordinator was amazing. Matt took time to explain things to me and gave me clear instructions when scheduling my shifts. During my stay, Doctor and I took great care of each other. I thank all of the staff for taking care of my situation in hospital."
Positief,I like to thank all of the staff at the Hospital for allowing me the best care and recovery I had. I am very recovering from kidney failure and am recovering well on my own.
Positief,"I like to thank all the staff that I have received from the Medical Examiner, your incredible care, and the amazing team of team doctors that I have seen from all over the world. My husband got dizzy on his way to appointments and there was never a problem. I was in labor and the labor department did not have enough nurses and what was needed most of all they could do was to bring food and meds. I will never go to another hospital that does not rely on you, Dr. Ramirez, and for that we are very grateful......"
Positief,"I like to thank all the staff who provided A LOT of answers as to what I had been experiencing. From Michelle to Dr. Hart to the nurses to myself, AOM to the rest of the staff I am so grateful and blessed. Everyone that helped me feel cared for was incredible. Thank you to all the hospice workers Jessica and Debbie who took care of me while I was in critical condition and Mary who took care of my mom during her own stay. Thanks again to The Hospital for taking the time to give me some answers as to what I had been experiencing."
Positief,"The nurses were so helpful. I was admitted and was stayed in a nursing facility for 3 nights OR 4 in a ICU. During that stay, my stomach was red and I could feel pain in my stomach area from the painkillers. I heard the nurse tell me her # and she called her PA. I called my best friend to tell her what was going on with my stomach pain and to make sure it didn't get worse. She thought I was ok and helped me remove the pressure pills. I was very happy with how things were going."
Positief,"The nurses were so supportive and friendly that I couldn't wait to see the doctors. When I got to the operating room I was greeted with lots of smiles and a warm, fuzzy feeling coming from my legs. I was reassured by the knowledgeable team that came in to see me. I wish I had known that I would have been born in the U.S. I've always been very sensitive to how this world treats me and I cannot thank them enough for all of their caring."
Positief,"The nurses were so wonderful and the rest of the staff was so kind, gentle, and helpful. All of the staff were able to assist with taking care of me during my hospitalization. Thank you to my great wonderful recovery nurse Debbie who got me started right away. Would highly recommend this facility"
Positief,The nurses were so great!!! The doctors were always very compassionate and kind people. I went to the emergency room one night because my 3 months old was so sick and had an an ICU. My husband needed heart surgery and was in critical condition for days. The surgeons were also wonderful! The hospital is amazing. I highly recommend The Hospital!!!
Positief,"The nurses were so happy to have them. They were so helpful and kind, encouraging. They made me feel comfortable with the care I received. I felt comfortable just like myself and not like a hospital or anything with a waiting list. The service was prompt, allowing for patients to feel confident and confident in their care."
Positief,The nurses were so helpful and professional. They ensured me with an uninterrupted clean up and recovery. I was cared for in the ICU and received 24hrs of IVF for follow up testing. I received my discharge and I am pleased with my health. I highly recommended These Transplant Nurse Bldg Centers.
Positief,My procedure went well. There were no signs of infection or bleeding. I was not hungry and had no major complaints. The medications were relatively inexpensive and relatively safe. The patient resource team was excellent and very professional. They kept all of the details under control and explained each additional action as needed.
Positief,"My procedure went well. I had an allergic reaction and had to have MRIs taken. I had my own blood drawn and my donor donor blood taken. All the donors were happy, healthy people with very good spirits and very bright faces. Doctor and his team were attentive and detailed. Everyone was thoughtful and patient with questions and answers. The transplant team was also very positive and engaged. Thank you all for taking care of you."
Positief,"My procedure went well. I stayed in the ICU for 6 weeks after my emergency room (September 4-4). Doctor was great. I feel lucky that I have the physical therapist at my side for help with everything. She took her time with me while I was meditating, giving me directions, and making me feel comfortable. Doctor deserves the respect he gets from the other staff he works with."
Positief,"My procedure went well. I was given a 12 h nursing night nursing on Saturday morning and the night before my recovery I got an MRI done and it was positive. I can tell you the surgery went really well. The morning after my recovery I went to see my mom she was fine. She stayed all night with me and never showed any signs of pressure. When I got home, my mom got a red level checked out and it was 3am. I have a 8 month old that lives with my father and he is ok. My surgery was done on Friday November 12th and it went very well. The next day my 9 year old son was taken to a private room in her room that I had been in since he was 8 months."
Positief,"My procedure went well. It took 2-3 hours before my legs got any better and I felt almost dizzy again. They brought this facility in for me! The nurse were kind, gentle and listened. I may be rude or rude, but I thought she was caring and encouraging. It took a while for this to come to the fore. I will definitely be going to this facility again for the best!!"
Positief,My procedure went well. The medicine was very consistent and clean. Just wish there were a procedure!!!!!!!!!
Positief,Surgery and Dr Yang Yang were both in great spirits and very sensitive and supportive in the recovery. My husband has recovered well and his recovery is continuing!!
Positief,"Surgery and Dr Yang were so helpful and friendly! I was reassured that I did not have a high blood pressure, which led to a number on my high-end preop heart monitoring. They also caused an 8 hour wait for my surgery because some of my medications might not meet their current level! I would like to thank the Nurses, the Doctor, the cardiology staff, The Doctor on Tuesday night, the 3rd floor receptionist, The Nurses and all the staff who cared for me during my stay especially Jessica and her amazing nurse."
Positief,Surgery and Dr Yang made a great recovery. The only thing I had on my transplant bed was an egg infestation. I would like to see a monitoring group on site to ensure that I don't have any problems.
Positief,Surgery and Dr Yang were so helpful!! The entire team was very thorough and professional!!!! Highly recommend these hospitals!!!
Positief,"Surgery and Dr Yang felt that she seemed ok. Her heart rate improved in under 5 minutes. The Doctor felt relieved and went over to take her IV. When 4 hours had past Doctor Yang found out that she had died. The ECT team had been trying to save her life for months, but could not find a single person sympathetic to her cause. Today, they are once again united in trying to save her life."
Positief,Surgery and Dr Yang were so kind and thoughtful. Their care and instructions were as clear as they could be. Overall experience was not too bad since I had stomach pains that ended the evening.
Positief,"Super compassion and caring for you every step of the way. From the pre-op nurse to the nurses in the resident care the staff on the 6th floor are top notch. From the tech support to the post surgery nurse the entire staff has it all: heart rate and pulse monitors, MRI, EKG, IV and more. You get the idea. From the tech support to the tech staff in the ER to scheduling and follow up visits, everything is top notch. I highly recommend The Hospital."
Positief,Super compassion and caring attitude make this experience as smooth and comfortable as it can possibly be. Just a few questions! Thanks everyone for taking the stress away!
Positief,Super compassion and caring staff led us to our room and the best care was given. The surgeons went above and beyond to ensure that we had the best surgery taking place. Thank you all for helping us bring life into this world
Positief,"Super compassion and caring staff give you the answers you need. They will explain everything from time to time and give you the best medical care you'll ever have. They're compassionate, analytical, professional, helpful, and transparent with your care. We feel like family every time someone listens!"
Positief,Super compassion and caring staff made making this process as smooth and efficient as possible
Positief,Super compassion and caring on the road. It made the journey an easy one. I stayed overnight with my girlfriend and we went from feeling rough on our first night in the hospital to feeling more comfortable the following morning. It was calming to know someone cared about me.
Positief,"The Hospital Exceeded my Expectations & was Highly Enjoying! I Had My 3rd Doctor on Friday Jan the 14th 2017 & he arrived very quickly & took my wellbeing into his own hands with a smile on his face. Dr Evans was efficient, efficient & sensitive every step of the way. My Surgery took more than a minute & the Doctor was on time & able to assist me with any major issues. Dr Ford was very helpful & detailed with me & took his time with me. My Expectations were very good & I was satisfied with my Expectations. The Hospital is also an excellent aid & support center."
Positief,"The Hospital Exceeded my Expectations! They were Awesome The hospital is A must visit! Doctor, Nurse Practitioner, Doctor all treated my Expectations with the the best care possible. And I must say, the patient registration process took me 1-2 hours. You cannot go wrong with this hospital. If you are in need of medical aid, this hospital is right next door! The food was good too! I would highly recommend The Hospital for your medical needs."
Positief,"The Hospital Exceeded my Expectations! Highly recommend this hospital! 2.5 Stars’s for the nurses and techs, especially for helping me with breathing issues which can be difficult especially during rush hour when other workers are in the room. Highly recommended this hospital!"
Positief,The Hospital Exceeded my Expectations. I was very impressed with this facility and the surgical team. I am an IVF resident and the quality of care was superior to any other facility out there. The Doctor and the team listened and decided what to make of my situation.
Positief,"The Hospital Exceeded my Expectations. I got very sick in November and December and had surgery on Jan. 4, 11, 2014. Since then I have had exceptional care and supportive care from the Hospital. People such as The Doctor, nurse Practitioner, Doctor Ramirez and other staff consistently make it a safe and secure experience. I appreciate the team and commitment that each of their care has received."
Positief,The Hospital Exceeded my Expectations. I Was Here For 4 Months At The Hospital. Doctor was Awesome!! May Of May Was The Best Date Ever. I Was During The Surgery. I Had The Best Mother & Child Care.
Positief,Being in need of care and can communicate with staff easily and easily. The staff at The Hospital are top notch. The nurse who treats me and her wonderful team are top notch as well. The Doctor is an amazing Doctor with a long history of caring for his patients. Thank you to all the nursing staff who showed love and patience while I was away for The Hospital!!
Positief,"Being in need of care, comfort, and support can always be overwhelming. The hospice and tech staff are always compassionate, friendly, and informative. Thank you for all that you do!"
Positief,"Being in need of care or if you are transgender are encouraged to visit Wegmans or The Hospital. Expecting physical, emotional and emotional support is priceless. The Doctors, nurses, PET concordinators, physical therapists and other staff are incredible. The facility even has a kitchen that you can make a beautiful breakfast in. You have the perfect spot for your evening of rest or recovery. The facility is also perfect for a weekend stay or during the week."
Positief,"Being in need of care is one of the most difficult things a person can possibly experience. It feels like you're being held hostage or being held with physical, emotional or even sexual violence. The best nurse I have ever had was Sarah Millar. She took her time with me and never gave up. If you don't have her number, ask. You are allowed to come in here anytime you want. She's warm, caring, patient-centered and always treating you with respect and dignity. And if you need help, she shows no mercy and answers wherever you need her to go. I highly recommend Sarah."
Positief,"Being in need of care are more common than you may think. From being admitted for operating an operating room epilepsy center to the days you were admitted for epilepsy treatment or recovery, there are truly incredible people and places to meet them. Getting information and a sense of where you are going each week is just a great feeling. I feel lucky to have so many supportive and knowledgeable people of all different medical disciplines helping me bring life into this world."
Positief,Being in need of care are critical to your well-being and quality of life. The Hospital is the only organization that can treat you with the best care and compassion. The care that you receive is always very positive and genuine.
Positief,"I have been inpatient for over 10 years. I have been inpatient for almost 20 years. I love the healthcare. Every nurse, doctor, technician, nurse post op or receptionist consistently treats me with respect, dignity, and care. The hospital is so efficient and transparent. To say the least, the parking lot and hospital showers are top notch. Definitely recommend."
Positief,"I have been inpatient at The Hospital for 12 years and since the hospital moved in in 2005, I cannot express the level of commitment and care the staff has received. The caring staff and doctors are always on the lookout for encouraging results and positive vibes. The Hospital is also a true testing hospital and each day takes a little extra to deliver on the journey. It is my goal to ensure that my recovery is thorough, pain free, and enjoyable for those in need. Thank you for making a truly positive difference to the better angels of our nature."
Positief,"I have been inpatient 6 times and I have NEVER had a match that match this hospital. Cory Doctor, Mariah Carey, Kristen Wiig, Jessica Chastain or Kristen Bell were anywhere close to winning this award. I feel like it was my fault that I didn't have enough breathing room or food on the 8th floor for just 2. They kept on putting food on the 12th floor until after 8 pm. It took over an hour before they got all the food on time, so there are always going to be times where the food is not always good. The doctors that I have have have been to don t amount to high echelons as they are slow to diagnose, followed by the nurses and nurses that make a diagnosis"
Positief,"I have been inpatient and recovery team appointments on a daily basis for more than twenty years. As a resident, I love it when people tell me their happy-go-lucky stories of incredible care. For those patients who don't understand the difference between a good recovery team & an ER, I will show you what I mean. The inter-Departmental team spirit and commitment to patient care make this facility a great place to be. The staff is always friendly, encouraging, and informative. Thank you so much to Dr. Hartman for helping make my recovery possible. I cannot express the incredible ease with which I could communicate with my doctor, nurse, and all of the other wonderful staff at this facility."
Positief,"I have been inpatient for more than 6 years now and my care at the Florida Hospital is top notch. I had a gorgeous physical therapist, RN, and a whole team from their team to guide me through this transition. Everyone throughout the hospital was so professional, patient-oriented, and compassionate. I couldn’t have any more compliment."
Positief,Overall experience has been good. My first supervisor was wonderful. He’s the worst I have ever been to’m’m’t myself. My tests were horrible. My discharge papers were too short to explain. And no one from the medical team seemed to care. I left because of an irritable bowel syndrome that causes cramps.’s was excellent. Highly recommended!!
Negatief,Overall experience has been pleasant but the staff rudely told me to shut up and leave no one there so I went to the ambulance and there was nothing. Called the med station and they denied my medicine so I had to wait 17mins for a doctor to come and take my medications. No one came. Two lines were ajar. Asked for medicine while waiting for my MRI. No one came. Was told I had to leave and wait 20mins for results. Took my medicine and walked away. Dont want any of my family members to know what's happened to me. Worst patient I have EVER had!! Disgusting!
Positief,"Overall experience has been good. The staff was great. The Nursing assistants did a fantastic job. Nurses were nice, helpful, and kind. The food and drink was ok. The service place was terrible outside. Parking lots were very bad. Parking lots that were nice and clean were not. Parking was at a bad location. Parking lots with signs that say NO PARKING ARE A NO CHILD EACH. Parking lots with no front lot is not A LOT. Parking lot number was A LOT and people were coming in to check out after being told NO PARKING ARE A NO CHILD EACH. Parking lots with no parking lot like that. Parking lot I know with no front lot is A LOT. Don't come here unless you are"
Negatief,Overall experience has been ok. At one point I was ordered to wait more than an hour for service to be made. Then waited over an hour for someone to bring me food and drink. I didn’t know it at the time. When I finally did arrive just before noon I was told I had to eat AND leave before noon. Total disregard for people’t communication. Total disregard for patients. Had lunch AND dinner. No questions asked for an answer. Asked for notes before leaving. No one to answer questions. Sat there for over an hour trying to find out what was going on with me. Then walked out of the room with no questions asked. Literally walked right away trying to find out what was going on with me.
Negatief,Overall experience has been good. Where else can I go for a high tech medical experience? From Aetna to McDonald's where I have visited more once or twice. It’s an awful experience from both a medical and a nursing point of view. But the transport system here is terrible the service is awful. The worst transport experience I have come away from so far is from taking the inflatable kidney bag which is literally the worst thing that can happen to you.
Negatief,"Overall experience has been positive. People who have worked here, been here for over a decade, can attest that the location itself is very nice. There are a few busy areas but most of the rest of the business is hand-ricked on each floor because of a parking issue. A few people have even been yelled at to leave. I know it’s frustrating because of the large number of people who are trying to get in but aren’t getting far because of a heavy line. After a few minutes of getting yelled at the other way, I think the line is getting long again. My experience here is a step in the wrong direction. The food is terrible. The chicken fried rice was terrible. The veggie tenders"
Negatief,"If you are admitted to this hospital due to a bleeding disorder or are experiencing dizziness within an hour of surgery, there are a few options available to you. You can call the RN (Public Health Network) within an hour, or the RN's office within an hour, or the hospital itself. I've seen this hospital three times, both times they attempted to keep me in the dark about the operation as everyone else got in touch. It took 3 shifts to be notified and once they did it, the surgery was complete! During the hour shift the RN told me that I would have to wait 30 minutes to an hour for the MRI. That was a lie. During the hour shift the RN told me I had 36 hours to wait. She"
Negatief,"If you are admitted it’s the worst thing that can happen to you. They treat you like crap! They repeatedly lie to you, cheat, scare you and then send you to unnecessary therapists to get more information to cope with the emotional and mental issues at the same time. I know these people aren’t angels and can’t speak for everyone involved. However,. It’s also beyond disgusting that they allow a staff member to lie about his care and discharge without proper due process and due process of law for them to do so while they treat each and every one of their patients extremely poorly. I know I will not be served food nor drink nor medicine! Discharge paperwork takes 45 minutes or more, and is still"
Positief,"If you are admitted to the hospital, they can take a day or more to arrive at least 3 times for an MRI or CT scan, due to the heavy workload the surgery entails:"
Negatief,"If you are admitted to this hospital with an ills infection,’tremor, you are in for a horrible experience.’there are NO nurse's notes or instructions for how to prepare for the surgery.’there is NO list of pre-surgery snacks or snacks to be taken.’there is NEVER a doctor's card with you to check you at the hospital unless you request it. You are charged $50 for the surgery (not the medical) and another $500 for the pre-surgery prepayment. The hospital did not return my e-mail or phone calls regarding this incident. Discharge instructions are not included."
Positief,"If you are admitted to this hospital, chances are, the only time you'll be admitted will probably be the evening before surgery, which means you have to be up for a test at around 9.30 pm at the University of Florida campus (10:30 pm at the hospital) to get a diagnosis of my gallbladder/vessel working correctly. I made a point of stating that I still had hope that surgery would be possible by noon and that I could rest assured that I wouldn't be admitted to a CT lab until around noon. Why bother with the night shift when you can just shift work out the morning of the exam! Once again, I find it ironic that Florida is a place of great health, with multiple hospitals and colleges"
Positief,"If you are admitted to the AARP hospital, you should get checked out in the hallway. You should not have your hands up or your face disfigured. Once you are seen you should be moved to the emergency room. There you will likely never be seen again because your loved one was taken to the hospital. If possible a letter from the hospital explaining their action is required to be sent. People who visit AARP often say they are trying to find a way to pay their bill but most people are almost never able to find out what's actually going on."
Negatief,"My dad's doctor was wonderful. He made it so easy to get my diagnosis and is able to answer any questions I have. I live in the Bronx and was recently moved to a different hospital, This Hospital was horrible. It’s actually a good thing because I didn’t make it in time for surgery. Surgery was fast coming and I was only an hour and a half into my stay. The nurse who assigned me to this hospital is a disgrace and should be removed from this field. When I gave birth, my IV came out the wrong way and then came out the wrong way the second time. I know I didn’t know then what I am about to get into. It’s been over a week"
Positief,"My dad's doctor was great but the Nurse The Hospital couldn’t find me a needle to have in my hand. I needed IV f’ng from a vein in my arm and couldn’t get it seen because it wasn’t clear what was amiss (potentially life threatening). So the Hospital would only give me an injection (informational) and the IV wouldn’t deliver the medicine until I got to 60. Then the forensics team would wait over an hour or two until they finally decided I needed a new needle. And then finally, finally CT and MRI could’t find anything that ended up helping! It’s a horrible situation!"
Negatief,My dad's doctor was great. But there were a lot of scheduling and scheduling violations at The Hospital after he arrived. The parking lot was terrible even compared to other hospitals. Parking Lot was empty and the line for ER was long. Patients were almost always seen in the morning and evening except for noon service. The only reason to see my father was because his father was out on a limb with a heart condition. My dad was just trying to get more blood work done. Not enough being needed to start the infusions just yet. Day Care I talked to at night was almost as bad as day care. Staff was horrible which I don't think is an accident. Parking Lot was empty and the line for ER was long. Day Care I talked
Positief,"My dad's doctor was great. I had a serious infection and needed surgery to remove a vein that leads from the gallbladder. The gallbladder is the third part of the arm that you have in the body. This leads up to the penis from where it meets the kidney in the vein. It takes three rounds of antibiotics, one for each penicillin set off, and each time three antibiotics are not effective. Then, each time, the infection recurs, and the gallbladder gets damaged again. Surgery to remove the vein finally fixed it this time,’s success. A huge thank you from the hospice nurse for testing positive for gonorrhea. You can see my chart here It turns out the test didn"
Positief,My dad's doctor was wonderful too’
Positief,"My dad's doctor was outstanding. Nurse Allyson was excellent, too. I do not think this is a joke. Nurses need a team but are trained for this job. And when a hospital needs a replacement for their patients nurses are often the last to be called. Nurses are just that — rude."
Negatief,"The service was horrible. I ended up at the restroom after 3 pm getting the flu shot and never even getting the xray. The medicine cabinet was empty. Not one single infusion was given to me. There was even a single cup of fruit juice in my hand. Only a cup of Dr. Mariah's. I am very disappointed with the whole situation. I waited 3 hours to be greeted by techs who werent even aware I was there waiting for them, when in actual fact I waited over an hour and they did not even bother to come."
Negatief,"The service was horrible. I had my shift transferred to this department after being admitted to have stomach pain. I had to be seen at least 3 times, once before I was transferred and once after that before I was transferred. I had to remove my testicles from my lumbar and a xray revealed nothing. It was only after I told my doctor I was going to lie about it that I was told the xray was empty. Then the follow up xray didn’t work after I wrote a follow up e-mail to say my results had been negative. Very disappointing. I had a 5 star rating from the health ministry for the check up. Don’t this office lie about the poor work they do? I"
Negatief,The service was horrible. My wife needed a CT scan to see what was happening to her arm. After waiting over a week for the scheduled CT scan since it was midnight the patient moved to the 12th floor which is much better since they had a bedtime feature. During the course of the month since then my wife has had multiple surgeries and multiple discharge papers that contradict each other and show that she was still experiencing excruciating pain. After seeing the doctor I still refuse to give up hope that something good will come out of this. My wife even took to the AFIB to find out that there was actually a way to bypass the CT scan.
Neutraal,The service was horrible. Urgent service to come in and there was not one doctor nor nurse with us to speak to us. My IV line was completely empty and I had to have a IV in my hand. Called 1 time after getting a text and asked for directions. Didn’t know what was going on so called for 9 people in total. Urgent service to start again. Called a different hospital 3 time to find out no one was there. Called 5 different ones to find out they didn’t care. Called again and asked for a nurse to come and tell her nothing. Called again and got asked for a refill. Called again and had no one. Took 30 minutes to go over email. Called again and told
Negatief,The service was horrible. The doctor I was getting into was very rude and made a point of insulting me before getting into my car. Had me take medication and put me at ease for 5 straight hours which was extremely frustrating. Then the bad doctor came along and came right out and took my medication. Didn't bother allowing me to remove any medication at first. Only admitted me for an IV in my arm and ordered me to have a cup of tea with me. After that I had to have my own IV in my arm and lie on my bed for hours trying to get my CT results. This made me want to know that I'm not going to have to pay for another visit because I know what I'm agreeing. Very disappointing that I can
Negatief,"The service was horrible. I was brought to an area with a large open lot and greeted by a nurse (I guess I was supposed to just step out of the way when the nurse came). I was then moved out to the hallway with the nurse sitting next to me. I was almost completely ignored, almost all being ignored in the hallway with the nurse. Once I got to the bed I was in, I was greeted by The doctor. He proceeded to tell me that my blood tests were negative and that he wishes he could have checked me more often to make sure I was not dehydrated. All for another $800. Horrible service at a small hospital!"
Negatief,"My friend is in a hospital for pneumonia and we were supposed to get checked out at 3:00 in the evening, they didn’t open the door at 4:00. Then they started calling and threatening violence when we finally did arrive. They even started threatening to call my mother to help! I want my child to stay home from this hospital if they bring these horrible, sick people into this country."
Negatief,"My friend is in the hospital after being hit by a car. Hospital staff at the time were wonderful but rude, did not listen to us and would not do otherwise. Hospital is far from well run and I've experienced this before where staff at one of their hospitals went missing for three years, my friend was sitting in that hospital. Was advised that I was in bad health and would have to get medical attention, went to the bathroom and then left after the service was over Not impressed. Called and waited over an hour for a one hour reception time on my son's room floor so that I could talk to him via phone. The operator told me to wait over an hour with no reception. The next operator said the service was over. They told"
Negatief,"My friend is in a large hospital, and they treat us so well we forget to step out of our car and get a drink in front of us. Why should I care? The staff is rude, takes too long to complete a step or even turns away at an inconvenient time. Ridiculous customer service. Had to go to an IV test, and now they treat me so badly they refuse to let me have another drink. What the HELL? Staff here is literally asking me questions that I refuse to answer. This is the worst hospital I've been to in over a decade. My friend has an epilepsy, and they cannot process my epilepsy at this time. The only service they can deliver right now is an MRI. I want to see"
Negatief,"My friend is in hospice and has been in cardiac arrest for almost 20 days. There have been multiple calls to 911 from people who say they are coming in that they are at this hospital from multiple locations across the country. All calling for cardiac arrest, and no one coming back. This hospital is far from beautiful and needs more people. Disgusting! Not to mention rude!"
Positief,My friend is in the hospital here and in the ICU for the hemorrhoids and a blood test has been sent out. No one has taken their medication and they haven’t answered any calls. Why don’t we get a daily send out request for every visit? Why aren’t we getting a daily daily update on what is going on?
Negatief,"My friend is in this hospital for post-traumatic stress due to surgery to remove a brain tumor in his right arm, which he'll need after recovering from surgery. Surgery to remove the tumor is scheduled for May 19, 2024. The hospital is trying to find additional patients for removal of the tumor, but some of them are calling for additional teams."
Positief,"Great clinicians and nurses. Highly recommended!! Went to the doctor to have a thrombosis check my jugular and lumbar ablation. It took almost 4 hours, 45 minutes and 20 minutes on Friday morning for surgery. After 24 hours I still had a huge red line in my jugular. I can't even fathom why a thrombosis check was needed. It’s mind shattering how fast the medical staff went. Wasn’t able to reach my OB/GYN yet, so far. Hospital staff was extremely helpful. They even went on a 3 day pre-surgery CT run to check my jugular. All in all the hospital was fine’t. I highly recommended The Hospital"
Negatief,Great clinicians and nurses. Only complaint was the service given to the younger son - not younger (20). Very disappointing!
Positief,"Great clinicians and nurses. The hospice is the worst place to die. I would never go to there again. Care never came because they checked me first. My 2nd night, someone came to check me but the nurse came, told her he didn’t have time to do so, called for an ambulance and left. Hospital staff never even bothered to check me before bed time. After a short walk around the room they moved on all to the next bed. After hearing that my room was ok, transferred to another room, dont remember the reason why."
Positief,"Great clinicians and nurses. Had my younger sister go to The Hospital this morning for a blood work exam. Went in the 4th floor having a minor surgery at the Surgery and did not return until 3:00 in the afternoon. Nurses were slow to answer my questions. Was told I had to wait over an hour. Came in 5:30, was greeted by receptionist asking me questions. She brought my younger sister to lie on the bed and wait 20 minutes for the results to come in. Came in for 20 minute test. All with no nurse on the 12th floor. Took 20 minutes to go to the lab and had her results done by 3:30. Dont know why there were no nurses. I called the lab"
Positief,"Great clinicians and nurses. I worked as a nurse floor floorin at a major hospitals in hospitals in PA, CT, AF and RN's. I came to the hospital for cardiac surgery. Nurses had 2 jobs: RN who got the cardiac diagnosis, and Erectile transplantation. After getting discharged, the Erectile was reorganized into a 3 job: cardiology and radiology. I stayed over from my other job as a cardiology analyst at Aetna until I was moved into other locations. During this move from Aetna to CGM in 2024 I moved back to that area and served as a radiology floorin at that facility in 2024. From 2024 until my discharge I was the Erectile and vascular surgeon"
Positief,Great clinicians and nurses. Very helpful with regards to their time when they needed me most! Awesome facility for neurosurgery. Went here to work in November 2024. Only problem was my EEG was abnormally low. Nurse who arrived was very good but not very helpful. Had to be replaced by someone else. I had MRIs but they didn’t move me. Disappointed not here because of services but because of staff - lackadaisical and overly patient.
Negatief,In general the service is good. The ER is terrible. Nurses aren't nice or helpful. There are probably a few that aren't impressed with how smoothly the whole operation is going. And don’t star the hospital because I think it’s a bad idea. The quality of care is also far from average.
Positief,"In general the service was very good. The transport people were friendly, kind, helpful, and compassionate. Had an appointment in 2-3 minutes and an errand was made in the pre-disaster area around 10:00pm. After that, no food, no drink and no snacks left. Very disorganized and disorganized. And then there was the Parking Lot issue. The parking lot wasn’t very fast, some people were overindulging and waited over an hour for it to be fixed."
Positief,"In general the service is good. Not everything at a hospital is always smooth. During my stay in November I was transferred to a room with a chart view and dialysis results in hand. I was instructed that I would have to get a prescription for a drug that wouldn't be available until I switched providers. The pharmacy then made a scheduling change that made my medication available on the operating table without my knowledge. All in the hopes that I would get the necessary info before switching to another medication. Not to mention, the cardiology department never bothered to get the results from my CT scan or MRI until after I switched providers. I guess the point of the service is never to get information but to scare the patient back to keep coming back."
Positief,In general the service is good and people are friendly and helpful. I would say that the parking lot is better then anywhere else. There is a laundry area (behind the toilet) for restroom usage. The parking garage door cannot be unlocked with a pad. The restroom is free.
Positief,In general the service is very good. The only thing that is not very good is the quality of the information that you receive regarding your stay and whether or not it is timely. I am very disappointed with the wait time. After being seen by the doctor it took almost an hour (I guess there was enough time for snacks and drink to be had) and the room was very comfortable for most of the night. The only thing that was not very good about the experience was the poor signage.
Neutraal,"In general the service in this hospital is more or less good. A few of the nurses are rude and say things that are in order. Not to mention the fact that I need to get checked out in the evening so that I not only know what's up with me, but also what I'm going to have to do once I get here."
Positief,"If you are admitted to the hospital, you are in for a procedure that, if performed correctly, could save your life. The procedure is called a PET scan. People that are admitted to these hospitals are trained to spot potential exposure to chemicals including formaldehyde, formaldehyde hydrochloride and even formaldehyde-tetraprim. They will then place the patient on radiation therapy for hours or days to find out if the procedure is working. Once the patient is healthy enough to take the drug, he or she is discharged. This treatment is called preoperative medicine. It is something that can be arranged after a patient is discharged and has treatment scheduled for a future time. It is possible for a patient to experience negative results after being preform"
Positief,"If you are admitted to the hospital after being admitted to the hospital due to a heart condition, it’s likely due to severe dehydration. The hospital does not have time for fluids, nor food or drink options available during the visit to allow time for the patient to fully recover from the coma. While food options are available, patients are usually advised to keep a close eye on their fluid intake during the visit. The Hospital does not offer additional tests or fluids for testing. A cardiology student should be consulted after diagnosis if necessary."
Positief,"If you are admitted to this hospital, it’s your worst nightmare, because they’ll never deliver you your medical results. They’ll never even bother to check in your room that morning to see whether you have fluids in your system. The nurses don’t even bother to take notes in your room, never even call. And the pharmacy doesn’t even bother to even bother to bring you any medications. My guess is that they aren’t very bright and might well be in better shape than this hospital at that."
Negatief,If you are admitted to the hospital it’s probably the worst thing that can happen to you. They discharge you without discharge papers or a prescription when you call and don’t answer questions. Don’t go to the pharmacy without being checked out when you are supposed to have it delivered. And don’t go to a pharmacy without waiting 24 hours for it to be shipped. They forget to deliver the medication they had ordered. I know what they are doing.
Negatief,"If you are admitted to this hospital, it’s probably the worst thing that can happen to you. They treat you like crap! They forget to do their rounds for medication and instead of doing their rounds, they keep leaving notes all over the place that say, 'I have no idea what's wrong and I need to see a doctor.' I told my mother while there that was not true and the doctor never came back. At any rate, I don’t think the facility is qualified to deal with such an irresponsible patient."
Positief,"If you are admitted to the hospital, each time you’re told you there is nothing wrong with you, you are immediately accused of epilepsy or of taking medication that is not supposed to treat it.’solution being that there is a website that provides information on safe, effective painkillers and how to get started. Not only are they great, but they also serve as a great way of showing that you can actually get started without medication. And this gets talked about a lot and gets ignored. People think they are getting away with it, but most of the time they are actually trying to help you. Patients are treated like crap, and the only way anyone can know that they are doing their jobs is through bad service is if they"
Negatief,A family member was admitted and was discharged from the hospital after being seen by the cardiac practitioner at 3:00 PM. The cardiac practitioner advised that the family member had been discharged due to a cardiac abnormality and did not possess vital vital vital services nor had there been any tests to be made available on his behalf. The cardiac practitioner instructed him to notify the Health Sciences Committee and submit a report by the evening of the discharge. He did not deliver the report until 5:00 PM. The Health Sciences Committee decided to proceed. The father was discharged without cause on 20 November 2024.

Positief,"A family member was transferred to a facility for post surgery care. I had been admitted to the hospital as a child and while in this state prior service with the hospital’s child labor facility (CPOL)’s personnel performed an in discharging discharge on August 24, 2024. After receiving a discharge form for that purpose, the hospital transferred my family member to the Child Protective Services (CPS) team. During their visit, CPS and our labor attorney requested an autopsy. During the autopsy, CPS agreed to my physical and mental health not be transferred to CPS. During our follow up visit, we agreed during the course of the follow up that we would not be trying to transfer someone else's physical and mental health to CPS."
Negatief,A family member was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. The staff at The Hospital were absolutely horrible!! They left us in the dark regarding why we needed antibiotics and waited over a week after starting the procedure to get an idea of what was really going on. Then charged us with an 'already admitted' discharge once we admitted that we were infected!!! The hospital was so off on getting us know that they didn't bother to even bother to check us out until they called!! The staff here is terrible’t Aiken. They should be ashamed of themselves!!!!!
Positief,"A family member was treated and discharged from the hospital in just over a week. I fully expect this to be a major debacle regarding the care received within the medical establishment. Hospital administrators and staff must absolutely and unequivocally discharge this family member with prejudice and severing diplomatic immunity.’s member was trained and trained as a nurse practitioner and as such is subject to disciplinary action by the health department. The medical staff at this hospital are completely uninterested in the medical student.’s care and are trying to get her into some of the more prestigious hospitals across the country. Hospital administrators seem to think that the medical care they receive is a'special' issue, which in my experience is the case. Hospital administrators seem to forget that they are responsible"
Negatief,"I have mixed feelings about the process. I had my 3rd surgery in May 2013, and my surgery last month was the worst since I started getting better after getting a 2nd hip replacement a few months ago. Surgery was pretty challenging and involved, but the nurses and doctors were not friendly and there was never any tension in the 4th grade physical therapist department."
Neutraal,"I have mixed feelings about my experience here at The Hospital after being discharged from the hospital. I was transferred into a nursing position and taken to the operating room 2 hours after my discharge in the morning. I was advised it would take 2 hours and 45 minutes for my IV to be inserted. Not one bell rang, not two were called. A nurse came in the room at 1:30 and informed me there was nothing in the work schedule. Later that night, a nurse came in the room at 2:00:00 for a pre-surgery IV line checked out. I didn’t know she was in the operating room at this time. Later that night — after being informed by a nurse that the infusions weren’t"
Positief,"I have mixed feelings about my experience here at the hospital recently, with my family members diagnosed recently. I started taking medicine about a month ago due to kidney failure after going into surgery and experiencing a seizure a few weeks ago. While I appreciate that I was able to receive proper care and surgery at once, there have been issues with discharge paperwork due to unexpected discharge status changes at this time. The medical team has been extremely helpful. During my stay, I was able to get more detailed instructions regarding my care and surgery and the specific testing methodology being carried out. I appreciate a quicker process and more time, but until both parties can be assured the results for the individual tests are available, I'll be patient with that status quo. As far as my"
Positief,"I have mixed feelings about this hospital. The nurse I spoke to seemed satisfied she knew what was coming. Hospital staff seemed to run amok. Nurses I talked to seemed happy to be there. As time went on I came to realize that I had to have bloodwork done at some point in the future! I realize that some hospitals ask for a waiver before they can issue a paper recommendation. They can't just say,""I would like to see this done before surgery…"" The medical staff then goes on about how great the surgery will be and how much work will be available. After a few minutes of disorganized talk some of the younger nurses I spoke to seemed to be impressed. I realize that this is a bad sign for The hospital"
Positief,I have mixed feelings regarding my experience at The hospital. I had a wonderful OB/GYN there’ll’t happy hour and there was a wait time of over 20 minutes. I got seated in the front row about 3 rows behind him. From there my OBGYN started asking questions and started getting phone calls. I kept asking for more information which he kept saying wasn’t necessary and kept saying keep asking. It went on for 5+ minutes which ended up not being necessary at all. Then the OBGYN started asking questions which I kept telling her I don’t need to know and the wait time was almost 20 minutes. Then the waiting room door was completely open. They started removing the IV line and
Positief,"I have mixed feelings regarding discharge and recovery. The nurses I have are very helpful, helpful, and helpful. The only thing that can completely stop a discharge is someone who doesn’t care."
Positief,"The fact that I'm able to follow up is extraordinary. My case manager gave me an IV drip in the hallway and I was advised it wasn't necessary because I was feeling discharged at the time. They called and said I had to come clean. And since I haven't been seen in a while, they asked for my debit card number. I have to wait over an hour. When I get there, I'll update this post as needed. Good job everyone at The Hospital for the journey."
Negatief,"The fact that I'm not able to go to a 2 hospital right now for a pain assessment due to my long wait for my surgery, is heartbreaking because I hope my loved one is ok when they process my final report due to the waiting process and the stress of chemotherapy and radiation each time. The medical staff at The hospital are horrible!!!!! The pharmacy, hospital or nursing staff in between shifts are rude. The pharmacy is accused of overcharging people to get the drug and told people they are getting the money when they don't even bother to get a prescription. I tell them I have no problem with that and they keep doing that. It's disgusting how they treat people when they care about them. It bothers me that the 2 hospitals that I went"
Negatief,"The fact that I'm able to actually go to the hospital and get a diagnosis is heartbreaking’s long and disappointing but the additional comfort of knowing that someone else can offer their experience and skillset to help, instead of trying to control my own journey through anxiety, tension and even depression. Being able to go into cardiac arrest in the first place is the heart of what I hope will help make a difference for my recovery from this devastating illness. I understand there are a lot of nurses and doctors who work in the ED but what I am experiencing is more of a disorganized experience. This is not some accident and I understand that some people find the process confusing and confusing at times but I am more concerned about the results than the results itself."
Positief,"The fact that I'm in a hospital bedside manner is shocking & disheartening. And the hospital I am in is NOT AFFIRMED. They should have given me antibiotics, PET scans, bloodwork and a complete sleep sample. The nurse and tech at the doctor's office were great, but the other assistants didn’t get along well with the patient. The way I view hospitals, they operate them as a medical service to the people, not a charity. Hospitals are places of worship and some choose not to offer such services. Hospital chains should step out and offer free drugs and services. Hospital personnel with medical degrees and experience are highly desirable. Patients should not be left in the dark."
Negatief,"The fact that I'm leaving today’s post as a member of the world's worst hospital is heartbreaking. It’s heartbreaking to be a patient was trained as a nurse and trained as a doctor. Unprofessional personnel, the care of patients and staff are not people’s business and should not receive salaries. I hope The Hospital can finally change the way it treats people who care about them, educate and treat them with dignity."

This comes at a time when the Internet is abuzz with information that’s concerning my accused child's case against me.

Positief,Took good care of me and was very patient with me and since then I have a 4.5 star rating from The Hospital for almost all of the testing I have taken and no IV bags in my system and they treat me just fine. The only thing they can't’t do is tell me how many times to each day to prep and post testing because my tests don’t take place until I prep them.
Positief,"Took good care of me on my first hospital stay in a nursing facility after being discharged from a 3rd hospital due to pneumonia (retracted 2 days later). Nurses advised I was about to be moved to another location because of a car accident that delayed my discharge (6 hours). I was moved from my comfortable car to a parking garage on E. 6th floor because the garage door wasn't very far enough to allow me into the garage. After a two hour walk through the garage door, I was greeted by an orderly who told me to leave the car and follow the instructions given. I told the orderly I had a scheduled appointment that evening and that was what was being scheduled. He then proceeded inside the car and started taking photos,"
Positief,"Took good care of me since surgery. Nurses and techs helpful. Nurses at each hospital seemed sincere, helpful, and kind. Was updated daily. The nurses came in at 3:00 PM for morning shift work. After that, they would come in at midnight to answer any questions. The only reason I let them in was so they could find me a spot on the 17th floor. Only reason I let them in because I was getting tired of seeing them. Tonight, after more than a day of trying, I would give any other person an update at any time. Even asked for a book to review."
Negatief,Took good care of me after surgery and went well. Nursing staff was nice but it took a while for everything to set in.

A physical therapist by the name of Dr. Kelli Hartley checked my pulse and blood work to confirm my diagnosis.

Negatief,"Nursing staff were very rude and not caring. Nurses were not compassionate, never made requests for information other than how long it took to process the request, did not take notes regarding patient care, did not follow up after a patient needed medical attention within 24 hours, did not follow up on a patient within 30 days, ignored patient's requests for care within 24 hours of being notified of an emergency or needed medical care, ignored patient's requests for medical attention within 60 days and then ignored patient after patient for years. The only reason I gave a A or B was for my patients services and not for allowing my patients to take them."
Positief,Nursing staff were very nice and helpful. I had an appointment in the morning (or evening) for a follow up exam. Not one came. My bloodwork was stopped immediately. I had to have forearms cuffed and one across my chest. In the evening I had the choice of either a towel or a surgical mask to cover my nose. It was rude of me to have to get a medical exam since I have a prepayment of $500. The wait staff was very friendly. And I don't think anyone else was hurt.
