Positief;If you are transgender, you should talk to your healthcare team first. If you are a man you should talk to your doctor first. Otherwise, keep in mind that your healthcare team may have different procedures being done or if you want to have an abortion, they may not be all the answers.
Positief;If you are transgender or gender non-conforming, or if you are informed of surgery in advance, or if you are the caretaker or caretainer of a loved one, the care of which you are in need of, you may be asked to pay a registration fee. The registration fee is for a ten day period from the morning of your first surgery until your final visit. For those with multiple procedures taking place within the same month, registration fees are set at $30. The registration fee should be in addition to your current registration at the hospital. For questions regarding registration, appointments and additional information please contact the transgender resource center at 1-800-696-3075.
Positief;If you are transgender and you are not sure what to do, go to the Doctor. He will explain everything in a clear and concise way. There are also appointments for follow up appointments at 6am this Tuesday and 4pm this Wednesday. Every other Tuesday are 8am to 11am. Just make sure to bring your own bedding. The Doctor also has the Doctor Who room which you can find here. Every Doctor is very supportive and kind person, especially considering what may be taking place with my family. They are my amazing family, and I truly appreciate all the kindness, attention and support they have provided.
Positief;If you are transgender and wish to change your gender presentation, please call the TransAdvocate at 1-800-586-4357.
Positief;If you are transgender who is considering a surgery, it's critical that you are aware of what is going on with your medical team and what you are taking care of before surgery. You will definitely need to take extra care with your breathing, hearing and other vital signs. The surgery can take weeks or months so keep in mind that your health is at stake.
Positief;All I can say is great. I received free meds and everything was clean by myself. Definitely recommend taking them.
Positief;All I can say is that I are very pleased with my surgical center. From the first visit I went in they were great! The nurses and techs were attentive and kept making me feel aware of the procedures and making sure I was healthy and on time. Being in a nursing facility is very different experience from someone who is visiting family or taking care of your sick child. I will never again rely on an emergency room for care nor should I rely on someone else to bring my child to hospital. The staff is beyond amazing and if I could give more then 5 stars I would!
Positief;All I can say is great. In fact the staff was really helpful and kind and made appointments. I needed a bedside manner and there was none. I felt like there were nurses in the back and just someone taking care of my busy schedule. The entire staff was very thoughtful, helpful, and informative. Had an awesome experience.
Positief;All I can say, is Awesome. I did a 12 week recovery, and then transferred to The Hospital for a 12 week recovery. I was fine for 6 weeks, at least, I'm sure there was some scheduling issues. Had pain in the back of the head, back pain when I was nursing or if I was taking medications or anything, and I was fine. The doctor did not make any appointments, however, Dr. Soliman did post appointments for me at 3 a.m.. I couldn't make out where my doctor was or who was taking care of me. Had A LOT of issues, but didn't get into too much detail. The doctors, surgery team, nurses, All the other staff on the team, and I
Positief;All I can say is great. As someone who has followed my surgical recovery and recovery with particular care each step of the way, from recovery to post-op, I am incredibly grateful. I am especially pleased that the Institute of Cardiology and the Institute of Occupational Therapy have helped take care of my medical needs while I am at recovery following this traumatic experience. Thank you very much for taking the battle to my late husband.
Positief;My son was in a hospital for 3 months and our first visit since January 10th took place at 11am. He was bedside by our mother and they took great care getting him well. My son had a very difficult time breathing and was given antibiotics. I had a donor who we decided to transplant because she needed breathing aid. My IV donor has since died and we cannot thank her enough!!!
Positief;My son was in ICU after the accident 4 days ago and we were extremely scared and took to The Hospital. They took the time to explain everything and made us feel comfortable. The nurses were great! The doctors were friendly, helpful, and took our needs into consideration. Even our 1st time patient had good stomach and was treated with care. The Doctor was able to assist us with medications and a recovering heart. Thank you @ The Hospital for making a truly wonderful healing place possible for my son. Thank you to all of the staff for helping us regain our spirits and make us feel comfortable again. I would like to thank The Hospital and all the care it provided us. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all the nurses and staff
Positief;My son was in ICU on Tuesday evening and was in great shape. My husband stayed with us for the entire 4 weeks and was fine throughout this entire recovery. Dr. Yang was the nephrologist and nurse on the whole team. Dr. Yang is a great veep and she is a great resource for all of our care. From scheduling appointments to pre-op screenings to extra medicine and recovery. Thank you Dr. Yang for taking care of our son. Thank you again for making a better tomorrow possible.
Positief;My son was in hospital for three days after being hit by a truck. When he arrived he was fine. One night he got in between the nurses and someone called 911. The other night just after his 12th birthday he was stopped by medics for being on the side of the road. He told them he was hit by a truck and that he didn't remember taking any painkillers. It was then that they decided to have an MRI. Dr. Ramirez had a good team there to take his beating into account. The Doctor and his staff are top notch. The doctors and nurses are always encouraging and patient-centered. I especially like Michelle Hartley, her husband who I have known for 14 years. Michelle and his 12-year-
Positief;My son was in ICU after getting heart surgery. We received the best care possible from our hospice nurse, Mariah. She was the best Doctor and the nurses that they came across were always impressed with the labor and the care that went into making sure my son was well. They would bring him food, water, and even ice cream even though he wasn't breathing very well. Thank you Mariah. You truly are the backbone to our family and each and every one of the staff that you visit are incredible.
Positief;I gave birth to my first baby here in May. I am an Inchicote RN so had the best care anyone can give. I had to go to The Hospital for an ultrasound and every nurse and technician was top notch. Their hospital parking lot is gorgeous. I highly recommend them. The staff was great as always. I have had excellent food and drink at the bar and in the food court. It was so nice having a family as well. Would definitely come back here again.
Positief;I gave birth to twins and we are both blessed to have them as a baby. They are the best doctors who I have ever have. Thank you all so much to all the beautiful nurses and staff! Best regards,
Positief;I gave birth to twins at The Hospital. Both of my youngest twins were healthy and well-fed. They were given antibiotics for the night following delivery and stayed for the week. Their care was exceptional. I don�t have enough words�s words about the surgeons, The Hospital staff or the nurses that made my baby happy.
Positief;I gave birth to my first baby and she was amazing. Every doctor, nursing and post shift person was so friendly and accommodating. I understand this is not every day you have the best birth team to offer and everyone on the team was amazing. I love how thoughtful, caring and detailed everyone was. If you are pregnant or nursing with a partner and feel the need to stay up late due to heavy stuff like delivery or overnight stay then feel free to call us at (866) 962-4100. We have a staff of over 12 so feel free to come in and meet us while we are waiting in line.
Positief;I gave birth to my first egg donor and he was a really wonderful and compassionate person. I couldn't have asked for a better family and I take great comfort in the knowledge that I give birth to babies at home with my husband and his beautiful, red-blooded donor babies. I am so blessed to have him as a match for my donor heart and every second spent with him is priceless. I hope that by sharing this incredible experience with you all, you can help me to keep in good health and showing the world something beautiful is possible with love and respect. Thank you so much for taking the time to make a difference for my son's life and hopefully he will be a happy little boy. Thank you for taking the time to educate my family
Positief;Great experience from check-in to the office. The nurses were wonderful. They helped me a great deal and explained everything so much to me. Thank you all so much for making a beautiful day a little less scary.
Positief;Great experience from check-in and everything went well. The nurse and I were great the entire way.
Positief;Great experience from check-in to the hospital. Thank you so much for all the wonderful nurses that came and helped me so much! Definitely recommend this facility. You will be shocked at how quick and clean your recovery is.
Positief;Great experience from check-in, to the nurses, and even the pre-op techs helping us perfect the procedure. The prep and post-op techs were extremely kind, thoughtful, and supportive. I really recommend The Hospital.
Positief;Great experience from check-in! I didn't have time to prep the food for delivery or transport the medicine to your room, however I had great care given by nurse Rachel! Thank you so much Rachel for taking care of my hospital emergency!!! Thank you so much for taking care of me!!
Positief;After contending with their current operating system constant heart medications the team decided to give up on surgery and spend most of their time on the treadmill. The team decided to give their recovery a try and decided to bring their recovery a little quicker because of the additional medications.
Positief;After contending with their current healthcare team, my husband and I decided to make a change for the better. Today, instead of waiting for my insurance to issue a replacement, I'm able to have my current spine checked and my husband's surgical team treated more quickly and pain free. My husband has recently recovered from multiple concussions, including a traumatic right orbital contusion that allowed him to have his right side amputated at the same time. I'm incredibly grateful to my wonderful Doctor for making this possible for us. Thank you to everyone at The Hospital and everyone at The Hospital for the outstanding service you provided to our family.
Positief;"After contending with their facility since the facility closed, my husband and I recently moved across the country. A beautiful city with a beautiful countryside backdrop. We live in the city of Orlando and love the outdoors. I'm 24 and I love this hospital. I moved here from Maine and have a family of four here; youngest is with us and oldest is 4. The floors are large, calming, and clean. The nurses are extra and extra friendly. I really like that they have a goal to remove waitresses before taking care of you. I love how short the wait is for the actual procedure. I feel lucky to have the option of extra services."
Positief;After contending with their insurer and hospital for several years, they finally decided to take action. They are able to offer services like pre-op screenings, MRI, and pre-op visits at no additional charge. Both ER and Hospital staff are great people who took great care of them. It's been really great having them be my guardian angels and doctor for the past 8 years. Highly recommend them both. Thank you all so much for making such a great hospital possible.
Positief;After contending with their care since coming to this hospital, I cannot speak highly enough of both the staff and the patients that greeted them. They were absolutely beautiful. The Hospital bedding was beautiful, from the bedding to the floor care to the robotic assistive techs.
Positief;The Hospital -They are great! I have have had several procedures and they have always been prompt, professional, and informative. They have consistently provided excellent care to my care at The Hospital.
Positief;The Hospital -They are incredible! I received an A+ from Neurosurgeon about a year ago and they have been Best Hospitals in the State. I highly recommend this hospital! The staff is friendly, conscientious and efficient. Incredible room-service especially for the youngest of patients who need constant attention. The nurses.. well trained, happy to assist you and taking their time with you. Highly recommended.
Positief;The Hospital -They are very attentive, friendly staff, and if asked questions they will do an amazing job answering your questions.. I had such a good nurse on my first visit and she was outstanding. Their diagnostics and therapy can't be compared to any other hospital. Thank you all!!!
Positief;The Hospital -They are the best, if not THE best, transplant doctors.. I have seen here in Orlando. I would highly recommend them..They do the transplant and recovery for you and everyone.
Positief;The Hospital -They are super friendly and explained everything in a clear way. It made everything better for me.
Positief;My stepson had to stay with us and his mom had great care taken care of him. The nursing and allied staff was exceptional. The hospital has two floors with an extra floor for PET and recovery room, so if you live in the South you should have enough room.
Positief;My stepson had to be admitted to the ICU on May 9th. It took him at least 3 hours. The first nurse left an amazing feeling feeling. The Doctor was kind, thoughtful, and took his time with him. Dr. Vaskic (pronounced VARKI) was gentle, however she only took half of his questions. Towards the end of his stay in ICU Dr. Vaskic decided he couldn't bring himself to say anything more than thank you for visiting. The following week I received a beautiful beautiful pink heart! You can see some of the tenderness emanating from my right kidney. Thank you so much for visiting. May God bless each and every one of you. Janie
Positief;My stepson had to be reassigned from the hospital because he had the gallbladder removed 4 days earlier and his gallbladder function was not healthy enough to allow him to travel to our major donor facility. When we called the Transplantation center for an emergency room visit, they were able to find out by telephone that the gallbladder removal was taking place on our 1st floor. The gallbladder removal in this hospital was done 24 hours a day. The only thing that allowed us to get the best results was getting extra ice cold water from a hot dog stand. The doctors recommend that anyone nursing a baby under the age of 3 in need of attention be given ice cold water while they are nursing.
Positief;My stepson had to stay overnight with his mom overnight because of heavy IV usage. The nurse was amazing and made everything as smooth and secure as possible. I had no complaints and the food was good too. Everyone was clean and friendly. Definitely recommended this nursing center.
Positief;My stepson had to be transferred to a different hospital due to an infection. I was extremely scared and had to stay for an hour at a time. Every person there was friendly and attentive. I can�t speak highly enough of all the staff that I have encountered. None of the nurses were rude, questioning, encouraging, encouraging, encouraging, encouraging the person next door to me to feel comfortable or cared for. None of the staff seemed to question my medical history, nor did they interject any questions or make fun of my condition. None of the staff seemed to get too uncomfortable visiting with me, nor made any complaints about my condition. I enjoyed every minute of every visit.
Positief;The entire staff was so kind and accommodating to my needs. They went over my medical information and questions very quickly as well as provided medical transport. I felt more confident taking care of myself while recovering from the traumatic experience. Thank you so much for all that you do
Positief;The entire staff was incredible! From Rachel, which has been great doing a great job during the day to all the Doctors, nurse and technician are AMAZING! I must say that I AM SO BORED during this entire experience! Rachel even took 2 showers during the entire 3rd floor floor visit! They felt very welcome and took time to explain everything. The whole bar and staff was so attentive! It was nice having them aware of which areas have busy times or where I was taking care of myself! It was also nice having Jessica who was on the 6th floor nursing during the day and took care of me during the night! I was also very pleased with the 3rd floor facility for making my stay as comfortable and free of anxiety as
Positief;The entire staff was so kind, caring, and taking great care during the entire process. Their kindness and patience allowed me to navigate through the experience.
Positief;The entire staff was so friendly and provided with every detail. The service staff was attentive, professional and compassionate. The only thing I would have would've liked more was some rude beating the shit out of them by making up a joke.
Positief;The entire staff was very kind and compassionate. Kristen, Mariah and I were all treated with such a high level of respect. We were allowed to bring our medications to a room where everyone was provided with an ice cream bar. Everyone came very quickly and within an hour someone would bring their own ice cream bar. Kristen provided extra food and snacks for us too. Every person who asked were great people and showed actual love every second of the interview. The entire staff
Positief;I been to many hospitals and have seen great results. I can�t speak highly enough of all the staff that I have encountered. I cannot express enough great gratitude to the nurses, pre-op technicians, MRI Tech, or any of the rest for helping me bring smiles to my patients' faces. The entire staff is truly special. I will never go to a negative hospital and hope that I can save a life. Thank you all very much!
Positief;I been to many hospitals and they have NEVER HAD a patient who had A OR B OR C OR D OR E OR F ER OR F ER OR A OR G OR H ER OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR I OR
Positief;I been to many hospitals and they all claim to be the best! But what if I wasn't aware they were a real hospital and I had to spend hours going through the door to see if my procedures were OK? Would I be able to trust the doctors or staff? Would I need other care if I went in and out of the back door all at once? Would I need anything other than a medical aide or nurse to watch over me when I was putting things in motion? Would I need to bring my dead father in for an autopsied post-op procedure if I wasn't sure? Would I need any other emergency room staff, nurse practitioners, nurse nurses, EEG units or other personnel to clean my room and medical equipment before I
Positief;I been to many hospitals and I have never encountered any patients who did not feel neglected. I traveled to many states with no complaints or draws.�s.�s.�s. This nurses, staff, and patients are top notch.�s.�s. I�s very grateful for the high level of care each employee receives.
Positief;I been to many hospitals and they all give amazing patients the best care. I was in ORMC for 4 years and was very impressed by the professionalism and care each nurse showed. Taking time to explain each patient's experience is priceless. I also recommend The Hospital.
Positief;I recently had an operation on my right kidney and it was unexpected. I had been following my Caretaker Supervisor for some time and we decided that it wasn't too bad we didn't know where to get more information. I had just received a call recently from my Carepinter that she could no longer be found. But not only did she not give me any instructions, she seemed to be trying to get some answers from me. The hospital staff was so helpful that I had to travel from Denver to find them. I will miss the wonderful nurse and tech who treated me there. I would like to thank my husband Gary for the amazing healthcare he received. Just don't know how to bring him here if you live in the area!
Positief;"I recently had an encounter with a person wearing a surgical mask on my right hip that had broken my hip. As such, I decided to make sure I had an ER team there that would see me at least once a week. I have had wonderful experience doing such appointments; I would like to express my gratitude to a wonderful team of doctors and surgeons at the Ithaca Heart Institute, for making me feel comfortable and confident during my stay. I thank all the hospice patients and staff at the Heart Institute; for making such an incredible experience possible for me."
Positief;I recently had an appointment with my doctor. She was very sympathetic, compassionate, helpful, and listened to my case. When I was informed she was not working as I was wanted for an additional visit she took the decision to give birth to my son on October 12, 2005. I am very thankful to my husband for his labor and Mother Nature for making this possible for us. I highly recommend The Hospital.
Positief;I recently had an op procedure and after doing so many procedures my doctors Dr made me feel comfortable and aware of what was going on with my recovery. The doctors, nurses and staff were top notch�t. Words cannot express the incredible gratitude I have received throughout my recovery. I am extremely blessed to have such a caring staff and a heart-restrobing healing practice. Thank you to everyone at The Hospital, your fantastic emergency room staff, ppl, medics, floor-pumps for assisting me during the procedure and the entire team.
Positief;I recently had an operation on my spine and have since recovered much of my quality of life. The care I received from the Best in Transplanting and Recovery staff has recently been exceptional. Thank you to all the Transplant Partners who have trusted me with their lives for many years.
Positief;Everyone we meet are truly amazing and we are extremely grateful each and every one of the staff is so helpful. Each person is sensitive, accommodating, and informative. Every person we meet is so thoughtful, thoughtful, welcoming, and supportive in their care. I feel free to bring my health or any other healthcare needs where I live.
Positief;Everyone we meet are extraordinary! Every one of them are thoughtful, analytical and conscientious with regards to the medical needs of their patients, as well as those of their caregivers. Thank you ALL for all of the hardwork and love you bring to this amazing field of medical knowledge!
Positief;Everyone we meet are amazing! I really like Matt, his kindness, patience, and good humor. When we meet up for pizza he answers my calls and answers questions. I give him credit for that great service!
Positief;"Everyone we meet are top notch; all within a week or so of arriving at the facility we are absolutely enthralled by the facility. From the staff to the waiters, everyone who works here is top notch. I'm impressed by the level of commitment each person shows to helping the rest of us feel comfortable in their daily lives."
Positief;Everyone we meet are awesome. From the reception desk to the nurses, everyone is like kids. They're great people who care about the patients, and help us understand the care we give them. From the wait staff, to the doctor staff, EVERYONE from day one. Every single person draws their attention to us, making this a wonderful experience for both of us. It's great to have the option between one doctor giving us extra medicine or another doing some physical labor, or just taking care of us during the night. The evening will never be the same, because each patient deserves better. Every single person there treats everyone with respect and dignity that deserves. Thank you all so much for the amazing support.
Positief;The nurse practioners at The Hospital are the best!!! They are attentive and take your time with you. The care shows no signs of going away.
Positief;The nurse practioners at The Hospital, Jenny and I are all very impressed by all of the staff. The nurses and doctors are all very kind, compassionate and kind people. I highly recommended The Hospital.
Positief;The nurse practioners at your local hospital or post office both recommend that you follow all information with your pulse oximetry and medical history. The nurse practioners do also offer free space for nursing team members to take pictures of their locations with your hospital equipment. If you experience any problems, please call the nursing department at 870-683-4236.
Positief;The nurse practioners at The Hospital are wonderful! I cannot thank them enough!! Matt and I have been blessed to meet so many amazing people at The Hospital. From PA to Techs to nurses, PA is a must visit for any and all Heart Failure patients. From ER coordinator Candace to your Doctor, PA truly is the best hospital! Even Supervisor Jenny�s amazing reception is on the short list of things to recommend. Matt and I were recently admitted to The Hospital for a short stay and we couldn�t be happier with the results. The Doctor was as fantastic as he was efficient and took his time with us. Unfortunately for him, during the stay, his ORTHODONTAL VACATION started to show signs
Positief;The nurse practioners at The Hospital have been very compassionate and compassionate throughout this entire journey. They have been my trusted prept nurse companion and nurse companion since the day I was born. I have been blessed with the comfort of their caring and helpful staff. I cannot thank them enough. Thank you all for taking your healthcare and making a difference for each of us!
Positief;I like to thank the The Hospital for allowing me to meet with them. I have had several heart transplant procedures and it has been a great experience. For those of you who are new to Heart transplant care or the surgical techs, this facility is by far the best facility. I'm not an expert, myself nor do I have the best EEG or other procedures performed at my facility, but The Hospital is absolutely top notch. The staff as well as Dr. Dieter Reiter are truly amazing
Positief;I like to thank the following for the outstanding care given to me by Doctor Ethel Perlmutter. She took great care of me during my stay at The Hospital. The hospital has a good team of nursing staff, allied staff, and emergency room meds all working hard to bring me healthful, happy, and beautiful life-changing results. I highly recommend The Hospital to all of you.
Positief;I like to thank all the staff at The Hospital for taking care of my amazing sick kids and wonderful caregivers at The Hospital. Every Friday I would like to give a heartfelt thanks to all the doctors and nurses and staff and everyone behind baroque floors at The Hospital. I absolutely adore each and every one of their services. Thank you everyone from the Lead Nurses to the EEG techs to the neurosurgeon, neurosurgeon assistants and all the other wonderful People behind the scenes. I truly love this city and recommend The Hospital to all. I am so grateful for the amazing care and The Heart Institute. Thank you for taking the pressure off my younger son, Jordan. I am so blessed that I have A CHILD PRESENTATION PROC
Positief;I like to thank all the caregivers and staff at The Hospital for taking care of my father and his incredible recovery! Jordan was admitted to The Hospital and is extremely happy about it. We are blessed to have him on our waiting list each morning and he is very responsive. Thank you to all the team members at The Hospital who spent much of their time, attention and care on my father. Every second I spend in his hospital he and he feel safe and comfortable every second of his recovery! Thank you all so much for your kind care and compassion!
Positief;"I like to thank all the staff at The Hospital for making a wonderful recovery so fast. It was such a pain in the ass because I only had one kidney removed. I felt dizzy and had to be helped by a nurse. Unfortunately, I had gallbladder removal at the time so I had to have a blood transfusion made. For those who don�t remember, The Hospital is an all purpose hospital; you order stuff in or you're assigned to someone else. Not to mention the food is so good that I only ended up shortening my stay. The staff is friendly, caring, funny, analytical, and kind. I have no complaints. Thanks again for your wonderful care and good care."
Positief;My overnight stay in a very beautiful and modern hotel made me feel comfortable, informed and given a pleasant daily run. The food was also very good. The staff was friendly and attentive. I would definitely come here again!
Positief;My overnight stay in a hospital was ok, the OR staff was more on the rude side than helpful. The nurse was very rude and very slow to get to my vital signs. I didn't have much in the car so this was unexpected. The receptionist was amazing! The nurse who answered my phones was awesome! Definitely wish I had a little more tech knowledge in the morning to get my breathing checked earlier. The night shift nurse was amazing! She even set my alarm to come in if I'm coming outside during the day. Overall highly recommend this hotel!
Positief;My overnight stay in a gorgeous, private, and beautiful state of Florida was the best experience of my life. The staff made me feel held up and comfortable throughout the entire experience. Each nurse led by Doctor Rachel was thoughtful, thoughtful, and informative as she helped me navigate my morning and night recovery with ease. The doctors at The Hospital are top notch and truly AMAZING people. Thank you to everyone at The Hospital for your amazing care and amazing service during my stay in a state of peace.
Positief;My overnight stay in your hospital was wonderful! I'd been there since 11 AM and I was ok the whole time I was there you had ER staff coming in coming in during the night to clean up after you and when you got there you had the best nurses ever!! They were awesome!! They would take my mom to every appointment ever and that was over twenty minutes too fast for my comfort level. They always seemed happy to answer your calls and always kept you informed on all the latest information as well as how I was doing. You never felt rushed in any way and my condition never got better especially after 11pm. You have no idea how much better my bed feels and I'm so grateful to all the hospice nurses and staff who cared for
Positief;My overnight stay in a hotel that was very quiet during the day. The staff were efficient and answered your calls. The room had a large inflatable flooring in the back next to it where you could hang your bed. The only thing that made me nervous was when someone switched to electric room I heard someone talk about how old they were and how old they were. I wish there was a card to this information, but I am glad that I did because this information was so helpful during the night. I will never again live in a state that treats medical personnel with such disrespect.
Positief;On discharge the nurses and all the staff were amazing!!! I had a hard time recovering because I couldn�t get my hands on my own medicine and I could feel my legs getting scared as I held my own. I also had two heart medications in addition to my other medications that helped. There was so much going on in the room with all the medications I needed. My heart medications stayed on schedule and everyone showing such a positive energy. My Doctor found out about my discharge and he called for blood draws. When the Doctor arrived a nurse came into the room and she showed great care. She even shook my hand and said thank you for the blood draw. Thank you so much for the wonderful people you have. I'm very grateful to all
Positief;On discharge the nurses and every staff member on all shifts were great. The nurses also came in so quick, I didn't take any questions during their stay. Once I got an answer I asked if the room was too large for my bed. The nurse told me no. The room was too large for my large, comfortable bed and everyone seemed OK. The room was also very quiet and clean. The only thing was the fact that my father lives up there in the South that I don't live too far from. Would recommend.
Positief;On discharge the nurses and the whole team were amazing. They helped me so much with my breathing issues. I had lots of red flags for A&E but everyone took them very seriously. I felt confident in my care and couldn't wait to get to work. Thank you all 3 Stars for helping me overcome the tough times.
Positief;On discharge the nurses were wonderful. Doctor Bhatia, who had done all the diagnostics, was very helpful especially for diagnosing and treating my issues. They took really good care of me despite the constant beating. They stayed with me and listened for anything that stood out to them. They are awesome! I could not have asked for more. Thank you so much to all the staff at The Hospital!!
Positief;On discharge the nurses and Alyssa took good care of me. For several calls they would nurse sick from behind my back with a cordeur in my groin area. These nurses and staff made my recovery so much quicker. My husband stays true to his belief that he is God, and the care he receives from these caring and compassionate nurses and staff is priceless.
Positief;Good hospital & good staff. But I have a problem with the food. I've had chicken tenders before, and they were ok. The hospital sweetened the deal by giving me a little extra meat instead. The donut side of things was good, too. But honestly, they're just not the best kind of donut sandwich.
Positief;Good hospital & good nurses. May 4th for the best health. Thank you for a great year.
Positief;Good hospital & good staff. They are all top notch compared to the rest of the hospitals out there.
Positief;Good hospital & good doctors. Had the best care here!!!! Had my 3 youngest twins born in this hospital in December of 2013 & May of 2014. God bless them all!!
Positief;Good hospital & good nurse staff. The doctors were phenomenal and every patient was happy and well. I recommend this hospital for everyone!
Positief;"It was a very good experience. I'm in hospital and there are a good number of staff, including the RN, to make sure everything is ok. I do wish that there were some scheduling for those patients that go on holidays; I'm almost positive that we will all be back in 8 weeks. The Doctor was fantastic. You are recommended by your healthcare provider to have pain medication in your body. I'm very grateful to all of the doctors in the ICU for making a truly happy day possible for me and my family."
Positief;It was a very good experience and it was my first visit to a hospital and I was impressed by the quality of care. It wasn't as fast or complicated as some hospitals may suggest especially compared to the Outpatient Institute where you have to meet multiple providers to meet your final medical needs. Every patient was thoughtful and courteous to answer my questions. I'll have no complaints about the health care which I have been given all year and will recommend this facility to everyone.
Positief;It was a very nice reception, the Doctor was kind, courteous, and listened for any questions. The Doctor was pleased with his work and the physical therapists. The Doctor is by far the best Doctor, and he deserves many props.
Positief;It was a very good experience. I highly recommended this hospital to anyone considering going through traumatic brain injury. I had my own recovery waiting and most of the staff was very prompt and helpful.
Positief;It was a very good experience and the staff was very polite and kind. I cannot say enough positive things about the team
Positief;It was my first medical procedure at a hospital. My husband was in critical condition for at least 3 nights�s stay, which is why we called 8-1-1. The nurses and Doctor were incredible, and they took the time to educate me. Each one of the nurses was able to explain the process or provided us with a list of their names to follow up with. Everyone in the office was very professional, with details about each nurse's procedures explained and explained. The rest of the staff and staff seemed to appreciate their time and care. My husband was recently admitted to a large group room in the ER and he is in great spirits. I have no complaints about the staff nor do I wish that there were any scheduling conflicts.
Positief;It was my first medical emergency at The Hospital. I am 9 years old and am an RN myself. My mother works as a nurse and I am also an RN. My younger brother lives with his mom at The Hospital. I was admitted to The Hospital for 4 nights and 1 wound was healing. The wound was removed on 8th May 2016. Doctors are always happy to assist with your recovery.
Positief;It was my first experience with The Hospital, and it was my most encouraging experience so far. The Doctor is amazing, and the nurse and staff are always encouraging and helpful. I have no complaints, just wish they could give me more time.
Positief;It was my first job as post office post office supervisor, and I couldn't have been more pleased with the level of service given. A team of twenty-four post office technicians, nurses, and techs were able to handle my needs in a single day. Thank you again for all that you do!
Positief;It was my first visit to the hospital and I had the best care I've received anywhere. I love Florida and I rely heavily on the emergency room for care from the 1st nurse to the 4th nurse. The rest of the staff was very helpful and professional. I felt comfortable and looked forward to coming to this wonderful facility with smiles on my faces.
Positief;Everyone on the staff have been fantastic. It took an incredible amount of energy to get everything working right once it started. I can�t remember the last time I held someone accountable for something so personal.� Thank you everyone at The Hospital.�
Positief;Everyone on the staff were so thoughtful and friendly. Everyone seemed to know what they were doing and what was going on with them. During my stay there were some very unusual circumstances. Some had issues with The Hospital staff not showing a great deal of concern or empathy for the patient or staff. When I arrived I had very little time to process any of the unexpected attention. Only after I was informed about a long wait for another nurse did I get some real good news. Both nurses seemed happy, thoughtful and thoughtful with me.
Positief;Everyone on the staff were absolutely thrilled to be here! The hotel was great, and the food was good too! I would come here again and definitely recommend The Hospital!
Positief;Everyone on the staff, both direct and indirect, were wonderful. From Michelle which, by the way, is where my mother was, to all of the nursing staff, were outstanding. The night shift shift shifts moved really fast and I was always pleased with where I ended up. Each shift was incredibly clean, friendly, and free of any over-the-counter medications or taking too long to get on the right track. Thank you to both the pre-op nurse midwife and all the pre-op nurses for taking care of my mom. We are very blessed to have you. If you have any questions, feel free to post them here.
Positief;Everyone on the staff were so helpful, prompt and courteous. Everyone really listened and took care of their needs. Their photos were amazing too. I truly enjoyed the experience.
Positief;I was so impressed with the care given to my baby in this hospital! They took great care which has made it such a happy and healthy home! Thank you to all the nurses and doctors who I have�ve had who have provided the most incredible care and support to my baby. I would recommend The Hospital!
Positief;I was so impressed by the quality and technical care I received from the staff at The Hospital during my stay here at The Hospital. My stay was allowed to bedevigade and was stayed as a private room throughout the day. Only things that had to be done outside the 8am hour period, such as the paragliding for those of us with back pain or people who are nursing or teching, were allowed. The room also has a private kitchen to share some of your meals with your family. Every once in a while I take a nap in the kitchen and take a nice drink. The only thing I can say is good about The Hospital is it is relatively short stay compared to other hospitals. The service is prompt, friendly,
Positief;I was so impressed with the care given to each of my babies. All the staff was so kind and informative. I was comforted by the information given which allowed me to make informed choices regarding the care being taken. These babies are fine under these circumstances, and I am reassured that my situation does not need making any more difficult for ILL health or the care of any kind. I really appreciate all the attention which was given to my care and it meant a whole lot to each of you in this difficult time. Thank you all so much to all the caregivers for making a truly positive experience as simple as it could be.
Positief;I was so impressed with the kitchen and staff on site. The staff was very thoughtful, helpful, and professional. When I arrived to find out if I was OK I took the meds in under my arm and they all but made me feel comfortable. I was given a nurse preop appointment and she took the morning after to remove any sensitive or redness. She then took 3 more to remove if anything was red or red-touched. The doctor was good and then they left. I would recommend The Hospital. The staff and kitchen were so nice and took the stress off me. I would definitely recommend The Hospital.
Positief;I was so impressed by the care given to the pregnant nursing nurse. Every nurse, supervisor, doctor, therapist and staff member was so kind, accommodating, and helpful. This hospital is where I come to experience amazing things. The doctors, nurses, and staff are top notch. Jessica and Jordan truly brought a smile to my beautiful healthy (and sometimes tense) baby's face every time she arrived at 1 am! Their care and knowledge of my medical needs are beyond words. Thank you all so much to all the nurses and ICU staff who cared for my healthy, healthy baby during her stay at The Hospital!!!! Xo
Positief;Being in need of care is great. It helps me so much. And it means a lot to me. I can't speak for everyone else in the office, but they feel cared for. Everyone takes care of them with care and dignity. Everyone needs to feel listened to and heard. So thank you so much for taking the pressure off!
Positief;Being in need of care, we understand. The facility is small and the staff is friendly and caring. Doctor Keating is a great Doctor Who deserves more stars. Highly recommended this hospital.
Positief;Being in need of care must rely on a trusted hospital and staff who are compassionate, conscientious, and consistent on the journey. I speak from experience as someone who has experienced many traumatic experiences and felt the need to make an informed decision. I truly understand that my situation has impacted all of my caregivers and each of our families. But this journey is little comfort and healing compared to the pain, long hours, and agonizing journey it takes to bring compassion and understanding to the physical and emotional pain that is experiencing each and every person. Every single person helping me bring peace of mind into this difficult situation deserves the compassion and attention they receive to ensure my well-being and well-being don't get to be cut short. Thank you to our incredible staff
Positief;"Being in need of care and recovery; stay tuned to my Facebook feed for more updates."
Positief;Being in need of care can be a real challenge. As a result, if you are transgender, call us first and make sure you are informed and made aware of your medical needs. The TransAdvocate is a fantastic resource. Otherwise, it is best to travel on private jets.
Positief;The Hospital Exceeded my Expectations For The Best Care. I was Expecting To The Best From University Of Florida Hospitals & Clinics. I Had The Best Outstanding Care For My Vitals & I?�re Highly, Highly, Highly Expecting For The Results Of 2018.Thank You Everyone For The Airing, Keeping Taking The Best Care, Being Kind, Kind, Kind Kind, Kind Alyssa Ramirez & Jessica for Exceeding My Expectations, Being Maintaining The Hospital, Being Tech Awesome, Being A Kind Heartfelt Thank You
Positief;The Hospital Exceeded my Expectations and Thank You for The Kindness.
Positief;The Hospital Exceeded my Expectations. The hospital was comfortable, modern, and large. I highly suggest The Hospital if you're in need of emergency care.
Positief;The Hospital Exceeded my Expectations, Best Prices & Best Care in Orlando, FL. Would Highly Rate It 3.0.
Positief;The Hospital Exceeded my Expectations. The hospital is very efficient and will always deliver you fast, pain free care.
Positief;The surgical center has an exceptional experience. It really is beyond words. I have been to several ICU locations and each one has been different. The facility is beautiful, modern and professional. I highly recommend The Hospital.
Positief;The surgical center has the best staff ever. Jordan (Preston and Jenny) are the best nurses, too. Kristen (Julie) and Justine are both extremely professional nurses too.
Positief;The surgical center has a really good staff and it is good to have that extra help. The nurse was especially pleasant and helpful. It was almost a three and a half hour wait for our procedure to be done. Once the procedure was complete, I had great rest and was able to go out and take a rest for a number of days. Unfortunately, my husband needed a good night's sleep and was unable to stay overnight because the hospital parking lot is closed. I would recommend The Hospital to anyone looking for a safe and secure night stay.
Positief;The surgical center has the best staff I have ever had! They never made me feel rushed or made anyone feel pressured into taking medications. They always took time to explain the procedure to me and made me feel cared for. I must say that I highly recommend this facility. They have been compared to Orlando or any other major hospital that would recommend visiting this facility!!
Positief;The surgical center has a fantastic staff and feel free to bring your own surgical needs. Doctors and nurses all come to us with genuine and sincere apologies for taking time to explain things. I recommend the hospital to anyone considering a stay in Raleigh. Everyone doing their part deserves a good beating.
Positief;I want to express my deepest gratitude to my wonderful fiance from Florida for allowing me to bring my only child to this hospital. As an ordained and currently post-op donor, his care and compassion are beyond words. Thank you to his wonderful supervisor, Dr. Dr. Ethel Millman for putting together this incredible team and taking care of all aspects of operating and monitoring the operation. In addition, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my family for their incredible care during this difficult time. The additional care and support of Orlando Hospital and the staff throughout both the day and night was truly incredible. I would also like to express my deepest gratitude to the staff during this difficult time, the entire staff, recovery team, surgical team, PA staff
Positief;I want to express my deepest gratitude to the hospice personnel on the 8th floor for intercessory care, hospital parking and opiate medications during my stay at The Hospital. The physical therapists were incredible. I had an excellent recovery and my health has improved tremendously. Thank you for taking the pressure off for me during this difficult time.
Positief;I want to express my deepest gratitude to ALL the surgical assistants and staff during my recovery. Thank you to Mary M. from Airmen, Mary L., Kristen from Florida, and Jessica, Rachel, and the entire staff for making this possible. Thank you for taking time to answer the questions I have. It was such a long wait that I was able to take care of most of my medical needs during my stay. Thank you all so much for taking the pressure into consideration.
Positief;I want to express my deepest appreciation to all the staff and friends who visited our beautiful nursing facility this past Friday morning. As we reached out to our beautiful hospice care team at The Hospital for an opiate free room, each and every bedside manner was respectful and courteous. Taking into consideration all our unique medical needs, we were able to meet our comfort needs, as well as offer free healthcare to all who visited. Thank you for all your support and positive energy during this difficult time.
Positief;I want to express my deepest deepest gratitude to the hospice personnel who cared for our Mother during the night of December 4th, 2015. Dr. Rachel Moore led the entire transport from the hospital to the Christ Presbyterian Hospital in Christ, PA. She was the hospital's resident EEG tech throughout the entire journey. Rachel is also an RN and I highly recommend her services. Rachel and her team of advisors helped us navigate the night with pre-op testing and other critical tests. I'd like to thank all of our staff for their constant professionalism during this difficult time.
Positief;I had to have an ultrasound done as well because I had kidney failure and the other day someone asked if I could have some ice cream on me and I just couldn't get it on. The nurses and I each had a different set of skills that made this experience more comfortable for me. The rest of the staff were amazing as well.
Positief;I had to have surgery on November 9th. They were very good Doctors. I will never go into detail about the care of my surgeon, but I know that all my surgical goals and goals are always in the best best interest of the patient. Thank you again for all you do.
Positief;I had to have a PET Transplant at The Hospital. The Doctor was great and all the other staff were kind and helpful. Only had a problem with nurse calling to speak with us for an order. It took all night.
Positief;I had to have an MRI done before I gave birth to find out what was wrong with me. Not only did I have a bad stomach that needed to be removed, but my son had to be kept in an MRI unit for only a week. I had to have extra eyes so that I could see the baby while giving birth. The healthcare providers that I visited also did a wonderful job. I highly recommend The Hospital.
Positief;I had to have my eyesal and hearing aid removed after someone broke the back of my head on a floor. It caused me to lose an appetite and lose 4 pounds. I can�t remember the last time I had a procedure done this way before. I don�t remember what caused the problem or why I got the problem. I hope someone can help.
Positief;This was my first time ever taking part in the transplant & I am so blessed to have the caring caregivers that held me there during the procedure. Everyone on the team & Dr. Ramirez were so thoughtful & kind hearted taking the time to explain every detail of the process. Dr. Ramirez was also incredibly thorough with scheduling & scheduling my transplant & the team was amazing. I felt confident & prepared for where I will be going next. Thank you everyone at The Hospital & all the staff for your kind care & amazing care during my journey. Thank you for taking the high road and going out there each day for the best care. Regards, Luis
Positief;This was my first visit to a facility for transplantation. It has a beautiful office, has a fantastic staff, and a highly treated donor coordinator. My husband and I are both transplant recipients from The Hospital. The reception staff was so great that we could not wait to have the procedure completed. Along with our good-humor castigation team, our transplant recipient donor twins found a beautiful clean room and everyone was so welcoming. Thank you so much for visiting!
Positief;This was my first visit with The Hospital. I didn�t like their surgical team very much and I decided to try their ER tech plan instead. I was admitted into the recovery room and was comfortable after an 8 hour stay. My stay was short because of dizziness and I was moved briefly to a room with the surgeon to get my daily dose of The Hospital's medicine. The room is clean, modern, and has a large room for physical therapy. My 4 year old son was moved to this very small room after experiencing dizziness and had to be moved twice a day. I wish I could give more details on each room as it is small so you may encounter other patients that are not specified. Everyone was great, listened to me
Positief;This was my first experience at The Hospital. The doctors were outstanding. Everyone came very quick and provided warm and reassuring feedback. They also brought a sense of ease and order to the experience. The food was fabulous too. Definitely not my go to eat spot, but it was tasty and had a good salad bar option too. Everyone really held their own in caring for me as I walked by. Would definitely recommend!!!
Positief;This was my first time at The Hospital and I felt safe and comfortable. I'm 11 and speak English well and know a great deal about the healthcare system and my family. I have been admitted at The Hospital 24 times and each time my nurse, tech, doctor and staff have been so kind, professional and professional. I highly recommend The Hospital.
Positief;The staff was amazing. The Doctors were excellent, as well as the nurse and tech. The rest were beyond incredible. They stood by and listened, as if they were taking care of the problem at hand. It was an amazing experience. Thank you for taking the pressure off my recovery!
Positief;The staff was amazing. I love how thoughtful and caring they were in making my surgery, and they showed such a caring and thorough care regarding my recovery. They also listened and took questions. As a result, I will never be satisfied just because someone answers my medical calls. They truly are the backbone of this organization, and they will always be grateful.
Positief;The staff was amazing. Each person was so friendly and helpful. They took the time to answer any and all questions. Highly recommended this facility.
Positief;The staff was amazing. I had a beautiful morning with my beautiful babies. My fiance needed more sleep and was admitted about an hour and ten minutes after surgery. So the surgery was on. The hospital stays were great. Everyone was friendly, friendly, had a little bit of a tension. The nursing assistants were beautiful!! They never felt rushed, and always showed commitment and compassion. I wish I could give more but this place is so good to have.
Positief;The staff was amazing. I would like to see more tech nurses, but that is beyond my wish. They all moved really fast to get to me. People took time to clear up questions and gave me answers.
Positief;Open heart surgery and recovery is amazing. Heart transplant went really well, however, it took another 6 hrs for the doors to open, however doctors decided it was time to transplant. I am very grateful for the incredible care provided by Heart Transplant and their awesome facility.
Positief;Open heart surgery and recovery. Thank you all so much for taking the time to answer my questions and support my family. I feel blessed to be able to live my fullest possibilities as a woman. I can't express the kind of appreciation and appreciation the whole healthcare team has given me. I cannot express enough gratitude to everyone in the making and staff at HeartCare. They brought me a beautiful girlfriend and I can't thank them enough!!!!
Positief;Open heart surgery and recovery. My next best friend Brett and I are very blessed. Being with them is like a second father love. So lucky to have them. Would definitely recommend.
Positief;Open heart surgery and recovery. My best wish truly goes to my husband, Martin who was admitted December 7, 2011. It was such a beautiful day. The Doctor was gentle and kind throughout the entire procedure and explained everything in a clear manner. Had my 3 young daughters for birth as well as our youngest. Highly recommend this center for your baby's well-being. A must-visit facility.
Positief;Open heart surgery and follow up with their Doctor. The Doctor is very gentle and compassionate with his patients and staff. He is supportive & kind person and thoughtful. Dr. Yang treats all patients very well. Would definitely recommend this facility to anyone experiencing heart surgery or any difficulty recovering after surgery.
Positief;Doctor is a wonderful Doctor, a wonderful surgeon, a true patriot, a wonderful person and a truly caring person. Thank you so much to everyone who took care of my mother and beautiful little one, Debbie. She recovered very, very well and is recovering at a good pace. To everyone who cared for her during her stay with us at Home or wherever else including your beautiful son.
Positief;Doctor is a wonderful Doctor! I love that I can keep my head above water while doing all my emergency medicine needs. I really love the nurses and their empathy and extra help with making my situation more sensitive for me. I highly recommend Nurse Practitioner Michelle Jordan!!!! Awesome Doctor!!!!
Positief;Doctor is a wonderful Doctor Who is the friendliest Doctor Who is a wonderful Doctor Who ever was and I will always be with him is such a great asset. I adore the Hospital and all the staff
Positief;Doctor is a wonderful Doctor and all the staff are amazing. The nursing staff is great and I can trust them to treat me with dignity and respect. I thank all the Doctor Who cast and staff for taking care of me during my difficult time at Home In May 2005.
Positief;Doctor is a wonderful person and I cannot recommend enough. She treats you with such compassion during difficult times. She has an incredible team which listens, takes time to explain things and shows great care throughout the whole process. I feel like I am in good hands after so many hours of hard working.
Negatief;This rating is not a reflection on the actual medical staff nor is it indicative of a bad medical job. My experience at the hospital was horrible. Nurses were rude, had to go out repeatedly for abdominal pain. I told my friend I loved her and she insisted. After a while she told me to leave, but I was still not back in contact with my friend. I then talked to this OB resident and he agreed to come clean up my messes. I still don't understand why nurses and doctors keep doing this to each other. This rating is nothing more then an opinion and a bad medical judgement.
Negatief;This rating is not for my medical care. My doctor recommended that I review the ED before taking any other medication. Regardless of what form of medication I take, I am still taking ED medications, such as a flu medicine (pill that is mixed in with a liquid and gets into my liver) or a medication that is mixed in with a fluid. It is my hope that by reading this review I would step away from each and every medication given me, because EDs are often an awful place to be. Every time I step outside of my checked-out area and take a medicine, I just sit there with nowhere else to go. It's not my fault that I have to go to a ED, it's my fault that I take my
Negatief;This rating is not for medical use. You can return your drink for a clean cup of coffee with a straw. After taking a swab, you will be asked to leave. Why do I need a clean cup of coffee after taking me to the bathroom? Someone who worked at the hospital who went into the bathroom was there for 10 minutes to 20 minutes with no one there. After that, a clean cup of coffee should be available for me to take home. A clean cup of liquid coffee should be available for my swab. Any medication is needed. I ask for a prescription per case and will not receive it unless instructed otherwise.
Negatief;"This rating is not based on my specific experience. It can and will change. Some stars and/or letters are not indicative by any means of a career outlook. My experience with The Hospital is very disappointing. Patients who come in need of immediate medical attention are extremely sensitive, need attention regarding their condition, low self esteem and emotional unavailable. Most hospitalized staff members treat these patients as if they are never there. They forget to have a doctor available 24 hours a day to review their urgent care needs. All in all, the hospital is a disgrace. The Hospital has a zero-tolerance for rude behavior. As Dr. Jeffrey Horan said: ""I hope the health care profession picks up the phone and says, 'We need to know this"
Negatief;This rating is not a replacement for an average hospital. This rating compares and disslims the staff to a large extent but leaves out important details such as which surgery rooms are accessible or how often one has to be performed. While there is nothing wrong with this rating, it is not representative of what we as a hospital can and cannot serve due to patient safety. Staff here at Nursing for this Health First Hospital at Ridgewood at approximately 2PM on Tuesday, August 24, need to be fully trained and trained on how to effectively service the needs of each patient - from nurse to patient. Nurses have a different job than doctors and they get paid a living wage. Don't lie - we are all in this together. Don't let people
Negatief;I have mixed feelings about the hospital. A few of them would allow me to stay in the car for hours without food and drink, along with my valuables, for hours in the hospital intensive care unit (ICU). Hospital administrators pressured me to do this, threatening to terminate me if I didn't do something about it. And here we are, 1 year on, no one has bothered going through with it. Don�t these administrators think it�s worth the cost? Stay away from it!
Negatief;I have mixed feelings about the way the hospital handled me today. The nurses and techs were rude, unprofessional and uninterested in my needs. The pharmacy was horrible as well. The food was terrible. All in all they were great people but didn't care. Discharged me on my own on my own. Had my RIVA exam and had to be at a different location to get my prescriptions. It took me 2 hours to get my pharmacist to arrive at my house and deliver my prescriptions. Went to the ER to deliver my medicine and was greeted by the rep who told her I had to wait over an hour. Didn't listen to me and signed for my drug when the rep asked if I had any more medication in my
Negatief;I have mixed feelings about the nutrition I received from the Hospital. First of all, they gave me a prescription for pre-diabetes which was never updated since I was diagnosed with it (my blood work was completely different all over the place). After being prescribed insulin, I was advised to take a daily bolus of 20 mg which I did not have. This medication did not help my blood sugar but it did delay the onset of my type 2 diabetes. This is not the first time this has happened to me. My doctor recommended we just get a second opinion and they had me have a blood test available with no questions asked. He also recommended I have a catheter inserted in my arm and follow a blood test. I am extremely disappointed with
Negatief;I have mixed feelings about this hospital, the staff, the food. Most people I talked to in the area seemed to believe there was nothing wrong with them - but here we are. Most hospitals don�t offer nutrition products or fluids. The manager at Ritsuko Hospital offered to set me fluids and medication to take when I needed them. There were literally no empty syringes. The manager at The Hospital also admitted that people taking drugs should consult a lumbar surgeon before agreeing to the change of heart. The manager gave me a chart to look at and told me to see a doctor. When I asked why, he told me to go to an operating room. I was so stunned at how little information Ritsuko offered me
Negatief;I have mixed feelings about how the hospital ended up disciplining me since they accused me of bingeing, discharging, and leaving my wife unresponsive for nearly 20 minutes after I repeatedly told them I was doing so. I was not asked to stop drinking and was encouraged to get up when needed to go. Nurses repeatedly asked if I had any medical problem and I admitted for a mental health issue. I am still confused as to why this was done and how they could discharge me without my consent.
Negatief;The service was horrible. I would call the doctor multiple times. The hospital would not return my calls until I called the morning of my appointment. After that, they refused to answer any questions. I waited over an hour to get a medical opinion. The representative recommended that I wait over a month for a second opinion. Then, on August 1st (oh wait that month!), they agreed to hold my medical opinion for me on August 2nd. Total frustration. I guess this is what it's been like for hospitals to refuse to listen to my request for care until I actually have to wait over a month for one and a half tests to be performed. The organization has almost no communication with the nurses or doctors either. Why bother allowing this ridiculous
Negatief;The service was horrible. I've been here a couple times before and still get called a lot and ignored. Then when I arrive at my scheduled time I'm told the service is almost over because I have an appointment not due until noon. After 5 excruciating minutes of waiting for my appointment i have to be called back or wait over an hour for my phone call back. Why is that so bad? Why are they threatening someone else with termination if they don't listen to me? This is the worst I've ever been served with my pay bill and customer service is nothing but a joke. And now I have a complaint from my son who was seen at the service yesterday and can't find him to see the doctor because my son has a seizure.
Negatief;The service was horrible. I would call the hospital and ask them to bring me a drink and then they would not bring me the medicine since my blood pressure was abnormally low. The last thing I wanted was for some surgery to fix my blood pressure too low. The hospital even admitted me to take a drug that took the drug to treat a different condition. Disgusting how business as usual goes for this organization. It really needs a better location and location managers should be trained to run this type of business.
Negatief;The service was horrible. I had my discharge report because my cardiologist asked me to, and I refused. After determining that cardiology does not prepare patients for serious illness, cardiology cannot treat a coma or even death. As such, cardiology staff had to make amends and arrange for nurses with long commutes to the hospital to transport patients from place to place. Nursing was not an approved special issue field, and it is possible to obtain a discharge notice without proper credentials. What a terrible experience! The cardiology building was literally completely closed off to the outside world. After all this, why were they allowing people to drive across the hospital building to the hospital without proper medical transport? I hope someone else gets hurt during this incident, I
Negatief;The service was horrible. Someone would come in for a long time, leave their phone at home and come back at the next scheduled time to take their calls from them. After two hours, the service was over and they needed another call. They kept asking this person multiple times for help, and again he would not come. After that, nothing worked! The last thing that happened was when someone at the office attempted to take a test. All in all, it was terrible customer service.
Negatief;Had a baby in August of last year and was told my child had died, I refused to see a doctor until I received a call from my doctor asking if there was anything wrong with the baby. Not one doctor came for over a week trying to find out what was wrong with my baby and my daughter. The whole reason for getting sick was to get a prescription from my doctor to see what was wrong with my child. After getting told that my child had died I went to the nearest hospital and waited almost an hour before being told I had to leave the hospital to get a blood test. No one there ever told me what test result I should get, so they waited all day to get a change of heart. The wait time was 20-
Negatief;Had a baby in August and am sitting there waiting for the exam for the July 20th exam to start.. I didn't even bother to go to the Emergency room when I got there!! Someone took my pulse and I knew they needed to have a thier patient when the exam comes!! I kept asking the nurse why she didn't let me in the hallway until I got over here getting my pulse checked out. They ignored me for over an hour. Finally got my answer and started testing me on an infusion drug. The drug wasn't bad but it was harder to get into the abdominal cavity after a thier baby was born! Was I KIND TO KEEP LISTING OF EVERYTHING??
Negatief;Had a baby in August my health deteriorated and we had to have another IV in August. This time my son Jameis has been seeing us for a week. It was almost a year ago that we arranged for him to have an MRI so we could sort out what was causing the problem. After getting into the issue with the doctor, he acted as though he could not address the issue through medication, instead he just decided to find out what was causing it and prescribe it. Did this seem to address the issue? If so, why did he say that after getting into the issue with the doctor it was causing the problem? Did he actually give these instructions before getting the IV in August? Any idea what the actual reason for this happened?
Negatief;Had a baby in August, my doctors told me I had a thrombosis. And I didn, because I had to have a second transfusion. The surgeon who did those two operations was a huge star. They had to have a hysterectomy to get me a vein instead of a percutaneous perforated disk. And they needed my blood pressure to be checked during the surgery. After that, I had a 12 hour communication from my surgeon with the surgeon's approval that I should have another operation in my home area and a third operation on the weekend.
Negatief;Had a baby in July, the door was closed. I was waiting for my MRI and a room transport. The last time I went, it was with a 2 day stay after being admitted into the ER with an ultrasound. It didn�t happen. My MRI only showed no abnormality and I had blood tests to test for a condition called thrombophilia. The doctor scheduled a check up for midnight. It took me over 25 minutes to get there. I waited an hour for my results to come back.
Negatief;Terrible experience with the Hospital staff and they treated me extremely poorly. My wife went in for CT my baby was delivered in August after labor at a Texas hospital. During labor she admitted a week after labor my baby was successfully born, and the nurses did not take him or her to the area they were supposed to see. Nurse 1�s English wasn�t as good as her first visit to give me instructions as to what was needed. The nurses I spoke with were rude and out of line. The one on average�s experienced a 5.0 rating from the hospital - which is a huge step up from my average of 5.5 on the hospital list of hospitals. At lunch time the 1st floor had already been
Negatief;Terrible experience with the doctor! he ignored multiple requests for bloodwork. did not listen to anyone. waited 24 hours for a blood test but never received one. called within 24 hours of test being scheduled for midnight even tho I had planned on getting ready for bed. waited over an hour for results even though the doctor already notified me of the test results at midnight and told me to wait over an hour. kept working bad sense of duty by not doing any more testing.
Negatief;Terrible experience with the pharmacy was horrible. Called 5 times about once for help. Had to go to pharmacy 3 times just to get a refill. Then went in front of nurse and tech every time. Unorganized and unorganized. And worst customer service experience I have ever had. Ridiculous. Never gets along with anyone. Asked for meds and they ignored me for approximately 3 minutes. Asked me for meds i dont know what i think i have them and im not even sure i have them. Then walked off with the medication I need. Ridiculous pharmacy. Disgusting.
Negatief;Terrible experience with the medical team. The nurses were rude, didn�t care either way about what we were going through - never called, never bothered to take a seat, never bothered to go to the area they weren�t supposed to be in. Very frustrating! Never a repeat customer! Especially after I�m so tired of waiting outside for a nurse to arrive when needed. Don�t get me wrong. I want a better hospital but a more compassionate and caring place to be!
Negatief;Terrible experience with the food department and I am sorry that my experience was bad. The food is NOTHING CRITICAL! The manager is rude and will not let you in when you're hungry. They even asked me to leave last minute as I was leaving food in my carry-on bag. Ridiculous!! Someone should have charged me for the food and I have no choice but to return it! The staff here are extremely rude and uninterested in helping me. They will not even tell you what kind of food they serve you.
Negatief;In general the service is good. You will be charged an average of $53 each time you leave the hospital. It is important and necessary that you know you are getting care and attention from a qualified, experienced cardiology staff member. The cardiology department is also more than happy to review your medical records to get information about people that need it. However the hospitals administrators can obtain more information in advance (when available) regarding whether you have questions or needs for additional services. The cardiology department, along with the pharmacy, are the ones that get to know about you and determine whether you have a qualified needs that need additional care. Once again, this is a business decision.
Negatief;In general the service is very good. I went there to get medical attention and it was not smooth sailing. There were an awful lot of people getting dehydrated and some getting seriously dehydrated in the process. The wait Staff was terrible. The room type was very bad with 20+ people sitting around a table that was almost completely empty. There were snacks in the desk drawer and there was nothing to put them on. The only place where the food was served was in the bed and the desk drawer was empty. The cookout was terrible. You had to leave the microwave on and the drink was on the tray and not in any pocket. The nutrition check was crap as well and they didn�t even bother to make sure everything was as
Negatief;In general the service is better. The pharmacy is clean and the facilities are friendly. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact us
Negatief;In general the service is great, fast. The parking lot is very busy, most times people are not there for a long time. Most of the valet teams here arrive at least 3 times a week which is often a month in a row waiting for someone to come to help them. With so many parking lots available even a few drive-bys can take a minute or more to complete a walk or a walk over a field. Most of the attendants are not registered nurses or social workers so this has a severe health issue. There are no safety features such as in cars, no one is in the back seat and the floor is in the wrong place. A big inconvenience with the whole service being a parking lot nightmare. Parking is also not a
Negatief;In general the service here is very good. The nurse I spoke with was pleasant. Most importantly she took care of me well and made me feel at home. The food was extremely good. And the pharmacy was nice too. I will definitely be on the outside looking in for this place next!
Negatief;Unfortunately I can�t give a rating of this product enough. Literally brought this to the hospital after taking an IV in an infected area during an IV infestation. The doctor didn�t think I was infected and instead advised I�m very likely being admitted with a fluid infection. After being moved to a IV in my arm, I�m now extremely swollen and disoriented. I know some people say they go to this hospital to get their daily fluids fix, but when they go to see a doctor, they probably don�t get the memo! My doctor also recommended I stop taking the medication and instead try a drug that's more effective at healing the swollen area. If you are a younger patient or patient with
Negatief;Unfortunately I can�t give a 4 star to the doctor because I was rude and yelled at to leave. I spoke with my father who was in surgery yesterday morning. After removing approximately 60% of my testicles and pulling out a large amount of fluid from my jugular, which was then placed in the craniotomy table, I was told that the fluid cannot reach the uterine walls and that it's a potential safety issue. Urgent surgery and I believe this is why I called The Hospital today.�?�t ready to take the test. The cardiologist was able to successfully take an IV without causing any discomfort and I am extremely encouraged by the way The Hospital has treated me thus far.�??
Negatief;Unfortunately I can�t give a 5 star to The hospital because of staff, patient care and caring. The pharmacy manager was rude and hit on multiple times when trying to help. Also The Nursitron accused me of having a child in labor and told me they already know that and want to know more. The only problem I have is with my blood test results which aren�t accurate because they weren�t updated almost a month after my discharge (December 3rd). The Hospital administrators are horrible. I had no choice but to go to The OB/GYN, which didn�t care either way. My wife has a severe uterine cancer so she cannot perform the procedure without anesthesia. Staff overreacted and told
Negatief;Unfortunately I can�t give a 5 star to The Hospital as they treat me a lot better than they usually do. Especially after I was admitted with a serious spinal pain. They didn�t care for the pain and ended up removing my jugular and nerve and doing nothing for almost 4 weeks. I ended up getting very serious and didn�t feel good until The Hospital finally let me go as far as I knew they would. It�s been over 4 weeks and I still don�t feel good. I know they were probably wrong when they told me it should have been a 5 star today but it�s been over 3 weeks of excruciating pain. The worst thing about The Hospital though is The nurses.
Negatief;Unfortunately I can�t give a 10/10 to the hospital because I waited almost an hour for my scheduled test results to be available on my desk at work. My friend and I waited over an hour just to get an update from the lab. The lab staff was so nice!! My wife of 20 years stopped by yesterday afternoon and told her they checked into their hospital today which she couldn�t wait more than an hour. They weren�t helpful at all today after repeatedly asking about my wife of 20 years to go check into the facility tomorrow morning. The manager at the hospital yesterday told the class that since class ended yesterday, there is currently no status update for class since there was yesterday a scheduled exam. The manager is telling
Negatief;This place is a joke! The line for the restroom is long! I had a 12 month old and this place is way more rude than that. When they take a minute or two to call they keep on calling and on coming. They will not listen to your complaint unless you say no. The manager told me to wait over an hour before removing my child and he was so rude he let me lie there in the waiting room for three hours. My child waited over a minute until my manager came to take him to the restroom. Then she proceeded to lie there waiting til the manager came. He didn't care until I said NO. After this I will not be coming back!
Negatief;This place is a joke! I ended up here 3rd Friday of the month from a 1st Friday of each month. The doctor went out to take a swab (not my baby's) a month in a row. Wasnt able to get my daughter to swallow a fluid sample. Nurse repeatedly said the child was not in the proper condition since her discharge chart listed fluids for testing. She didn�t care for the potential for it happening again. Nursing staff here are disgusting!
Negatief;This place is a joke. The only reason I came here was to review a new set of shoes ( they come in a different color than my old ones ) Also, I haven't been to this location in a while! Called after getting tired of waiting over 5mins for the front desk to let me know something was wrong with them. It took them 2mins+ to come in and say something so frustrating. I guess after they talked to me they realized I wanted to leave and wanted to know why I waited more than 5mins! Didn�t care for the way they handled me and the way I kept getting accused of not caring! So pretty sick of waiting!!
Negatief;This place is a hit. The staff here is friendly and helpful! And the food is great! The staff at this hospital are wonderful too. Even tho we were in a coma for 2 days our waiters weren't hurt. My daughter was admitted with multiple spinal lumbar infarctions and multiple test results in her chart. At least she knows where to find them. The food options here are pretty terrible as well. I'll be back for more.
Negatief;This place is a joke. Went by on a Wednesday evening for a few hours to get ready for work and nothing happened. Went out at 9 pm for my husband to have lunch. No one was ready until noon. Came in at 1:30. Horrible line. All around horrible line. Called 3 times for food. Didn�t get one. Called again 3 times for less than 45 seconds. Still line is terrible. Horrible line at the front desk. Horrible line at front desk. And back to front desk. Nurses aren�t social workers. They are some kind of hospital. They take a daily pay cut of $45 per hour, which is almost $900 less than the $45 per hour they
Negatief;Blood in the waiting room with bleeding all over her face. Nurse was nice but kind to not come on calls. Then came the horrible surprise of getting called to the hospital after being told there was no bedside manner. They brought in a nurse and told her she has more to learn, but she ignored requests for fluid, questions for ED and blood pressure readings. Then proceeded to make notes, ask for a chart via e-mail and waited nearly an hour to be called back. Not a day went by when they don't return calls.
Negatief;Blood in the waiting room was such a nightmare. Nurse's notes read 5 min leave and then the child was seen in the waiting room 2 hours later. Nurses tell me they never trained me on when and how to get there and there were times I didn't realize I had to wait 2 hours already. Nevermind I needed a nurse to check me and make sure I was ok. Didn�t care I had to wait 2 hours to be seen and trained on what to do after that. Especially after seeing the son lie on the bed bed for over an hour trying to get an IV. Don�t these teachers mean I�ll be trained on the proper way to discharge a patient after over an hour. Horrible communication
Negatief;Blood in the waiting area waiting room. I never seen anyone who needed urgent care until I knew someone there. Went to a friend's place to talk to her, saw the valet coming in, checked into a hospital and then transferred to the hospital wing as instructed, transferred over to cardiology and nutrition. Hospital was very nice - clean and had a big table with a lot of clean liquid. Didn't hear from them for two days - ended up waiting over a month for a diagnosis. Had a cardiac arrest and surgery last month. Nurse didn't care - sent another nurse with the same diagnosis - now patient is in pain, waiting over a month to be seen - no one knows if it's because of a cardiac arrest or something else.
Negatief;Blood in the waiting room�s room was horrible. Nurses weren�t nice. They left notes that they didn�t know about�s bed bugs. I asked another nurse what was wrong and she said she didn�t care and told me to stop. Then I was transferred to the living room to have my fluids checked out and an MRI taken. Unbelievable! I�m currently doing better at work than I was just a few days ago when I had the horrible experience�nding Heathrow. Stay away from Heathrow!
Negatief;"Blood in the waiting area,"" Ms. Knausz told The station. She could not answer questions about whether she was in the waiting area when she was admitted, what medication she was taking and why."
Negatief;My friend is in the hospital. They came in for her and took her to the Emergency Room after trying for a blood test, but they never came back. They are a horrible hospital! All of their nurses are horrible!! They don�t care about you�ll get discharged if you�re pregnant! Urgent care is denied even tho we are supposed to be. The only reason for stopping by is to pay a visit to the front desk to get updated on how things are doing. The waiters never listen when I say they are really nice. They never mind and never forget about us!
Negatief;My friend is in surgery. She has a seizure that gets worse as she goes. The surgery is horrible and the nurses leave her bed naked and on a bed with no heat and no coolant on her face. I would never leave my 5 year old child without her. Nurses at the hospital gave her IV lines to help but she kept abreast of them all and kept coming back to give them all. Every time I moved I ended up leaving her there for three months or even before she was able to use the bathroom. Ridiculous people working at a fast food restaurant can't even come close to what they are accused of. I'm extremely disappointed in the hospital which is why I submitted this complaint. The nurses and doctors at
Negatief;My friend is in the hospital after being hit by a hospital transport aircraft. They don�t take their time to help�t and�re�t considerate� of her� patient. They just refuse to listen to or care to her�s until it�s over. Severe pain, swollen finger and armpit areas all over the bed. Disorganized communication with family members, social media amazes me. The wait times are long. Patients have to be admitted for 3 hours or more. The hospital only has a 1 hour service available and the patients are encouraged to come out of bed at least 45 minutes before bed start time. This is an abysmal and abysmal service
Negatief;"My friend is in here and she says they treat her like crap and left her in such pain she has to be hospitalized because doctors never get around to her....so she goes out to the bathroom and picks up the medication she gave them and leaves."""
Negatief;My friend is in surgery and has been waiting for a liver transplant. They took her for angina and they discharged her in August. The hospital had two options for her. They could have performed a chest Xray and EKG, which can take 2 hours, given her a 24 hour pulse, and discharge her for any irregularities. After testing she says: OH MY! There was NO EKG performed on her! They discharged her in August. It's a complete lie! They discharged her and placed her in a congestive heart failure coma. All because the surgeon had told her they would do a chest Xray, but she didn't know that. My friend has waited over an hour for a chest Xray and EKG
Negatief;The care received from Nursing Home is excellent, from nurses and techs to the patient. The hospital also caters highly to patients' needs which is why we are very disappointed. The pharmacy and techs we spoke with were very nice and patient at first, but didn't listen to us when we tried a few times. Don't get me wrong - I still carry a bag over my hospital discharge papers and will carry them with me when I make an appointment to check on my loved one (who is hospitalized right now). However, at the Hospital, staff seem to think we are lazy and don't care about the patients. When we tried getting a nurse to help us sort things out, she took long to get our attention. Nurses seemed
Negatief;The care received from E.L.A. is of the utmost professionalism and attention to detail. Everything from the waiting staff (it took us almost an hour!! for any nurse in line to come by) to the front desk were beyond good. The food was good but the pharmacy were overbearing and rude to anyone who came in contact with it. Most importantly, E.L.A.'s catapults you into surgery when needed. The hospital's website is reposted at least a dozen times, without a single mention of catamance.
Negatief;The care received from the hospital during my accident�s assessment leaves with a bad feeling in my heart�s chest. I don�t think that is representative of the care that doctors receive.
Negatief;The care received from the hospital at this time has been excellent. It is recommended that you see a doctor by 4 to 5 days post surgery to check for any severe bleeding or any other health threatening condition. The hospital is located off of University Dr. Park in an unincorporated area that is otherwise well-lit. Therefore, it is recommended you drive to the hospital within 30 minutes of your surgery when you receive a call from the staff.
Negatief;The care received from the hospital after their discharge has been uncharacteristic of this organization, as I received medication for congestive heart failure as a pulmonary bypass surgery. Patients are being discharged at discharge via e.g. a cardiology lab or by accident. Emergency personnel cannot effectively care for them because they are so far in the coma and cannot effectively perform their duties for them during discharge. This is a major problem for EMS as well as Nursing staff because of long waiting times, multiple discharge times, multiple communication lines, poor training, poor communication between different departments (including one from each department), and often multiple communication rooms. This is a major issue for Nurses, as they prepare and deliver a large patient bill and then realize the hospital discharge is
Negatief;This hospital starves their patients and is completely over-the-top in their care, leaving their loved ones to rot.��������������������������������������������������������������?
Negatief;This hospital starves their patient and leaves them with the impression that they are living in a nightmare and cannot care for them (referring to the highly visible list of questions about the patient's medical status). The hospital records don�t add up. Why can�t they add a step review of the patient's records when the patient has admitted AND�s been admitted before the change in hospital? This leaves them with the impression that they are living in a hospital in Hell.
Negatief;This hospital starves their patients by blocking them from seeking care, effectively stopping them from getting the vital fluids necessary for a healthy, happy pregnancy�and resulting in a prepayment of the drug price tag for their drugs. I've been to several here and a number of other facilities before, and the quality of care here is nothing short of abysmal. Still, the medication prices are very prohibitive. At least this hospital is trying to get a customer to do something for nothing. I think an increase in the drug price is the only way this problem can be fixed.
Negatief;This hospital starves their patients.. they dont care either way about them and disregard patients need for care. The nurses are rude to the point where they are rude to their patients. In my experience with almost every one of the nurses I have worked with here at Nurses Office they are never even bothered. They treat my friend so ruddering that he is telling the nurses he is coming to see to control his medication. The worst thing about this place is that the staff keeps asking for patient info and never giving it. Nurses Office does not treat patients well but never give patients medication. They lie about the flu and hepatitis A. They dont care about the patients well. Never once do they even bother to step forward and tell the patient they
Negatief;This hospital starves their patients and is otherwise very helpful. The Hospital can and will not process or return your medical paper without your express written permission. While this has nothing to do with me being a patient and everything to do with a business relationship with a health care professional who is not close to me.
Negatief;I would die before going to this hospital. Nurses accused me of 'dying too fast' but I did not lie to them. All I did was allow them to lie about my bedside manner. I am so disappointed with the care this hospital gave me and the way they treated me. Especially the nurse that worked on me in the restroom. The nurses and technicians at this hospital are so careless and rude. The food was terrible! Total lie! From what i saw from the cook at the hospital i know the staff here is more attentive and carefree than before. The food was NOT DRILLED!! The prep time for the food was 5+ mins and the food was delivered way over the shoulder! Ridiculous. Didn
Negatief;I would die before i could go to the doctor since i was in pain and couldnt get up the stairs because i couldnt get in the car from the hospital which is an hour drive from campus. doctors were rude, even trying as hard as possible to help but they wouldn�t. the pharmacy was horrible which is why i went to the doctor to make sure no one was injured or in the car. that was 2 days ago
Negatief;I would die before Christmas of a heart attack. I have been in this operating room for almost 20 hrs already!! After being discharged from the hospital I was initially encouraged by a patient assistant not to say a thing until the care team came to see her. Then they asked her which part of the surgery to take and she wouldn�t. Then asked her which area of the surgery to take and she wouldn�t. The staff at the hospital ignored her politely asking her to move around 2nd floor. Once she moved around 2nd floor there was NO room for her arms. The room was literally full of nurses and techs with no idea what was going on when she yelled at them. It was literally a line of doctors and tech
Negatief;I would die before Christmas because I was so sorry. My husband and I were in Texas on a business trip. I don't know why so many people get hurt after being taken to an accident facility but they were able to transport us to the hospital after notifying the doctors, nurses and dentists that we had been transferred to another facility. All without my husband or I even knowing that there were any additional facilities available. I feel terrible for everyone but just imagine the pain that my loved ones and loved ones would go through. This is what a hospital should be like. The people at the hospital are a joke to the point where they forget to test people first or clean rooms first. The hospital cant even get approval from the FDA before they dis
Negatief;I would die before I saw my doctor, because I did not donate my kidney to a charity. Therefore, I was advised that I should wait over 60 consecutive days between the time I began receiving IV fluids and the time I stopped receiving them until the end of the 30 day monitoring period. What I didn't realize was that over the 60 day time frame, my liver function was abnormally impaired and I needed IV fluids in order to process the drug. This obviously made me more impatient and overworked than I otherwise would have been (I took approximately three hours to process my medication when I finally got home). At any rate, that was far from my intended results. I should have known in advance that I would be experiencing excruciating abdominal pain and needed
Negatief;All of the nurses and clinicians were wonderful. The pharmacy was great. I will be returning!! It is a complete joke to think that I don't work here. The food and drinks at the hospital are terrible. They do a poor job of greeting the various people who come in. The worst part is when you have to take a pic and a wave at someone you didn't think was there. It goes on and on. Patients are coming in with huge bags but don't know how they are getting them. I was once told that if they waited over an hour for someone to return they would take the dehydrated dehydrated food. This leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Worst part of my experience at the hospital so far is that I
Negatief;"All of the nurses there are great and are very patient. Someone at the end of the line yelled, 'Get out!'"""
Negatief;All of the nurses at the hospital were great but there was one statistic that bothered me the most. My friend at the nursing school who was seen at the hospital went to the restroom and got in the wrong toilet, after being directed to the bathroom by another student, proceeded to move his arm away from one of the nurses and then proceeded to pull away from her hand. I want the hospital to do something about the horrible situation and stop this such horrible behavior from happening to anyone else.
Negatief;All of the nurses I had were wonderful! Especially the one who would walk us to the bathroom when people needed help. She talked about how awful nurses are, the bad job they had, and the way hospitals treat patients. I am so appalled by this hospital that they have to close for good. I have a 2nd son living with them here in Florida and the hospital is trying to find a better care facility. The hospital is currently trying to open a third hospital but the hospital closed due to poor judgement from the Nursing Department. It would be great if these nurses were as nice and helpful here at home as possible.
Negatief;All of the nurses we had were great. Nurses at my child's hospital weren't as helpful. All across the hospital area were closed or closed for medical needs. The pharmacy was not as nice as it could be. The pharmacy accused us of working for drug outside vendors. The other nurses staff the wrong. Disappointed but we all understand we should have been better. Stay away from the drug store until we see them.
Negatief;It was my first time coming to Seattle and my first time experiencing this treatment area as a patient. My first time here was for a blood test which showed no abnormality. I guess if there has to be abnormality then it has to be in my blood set at a specific address that I can call and arrange my meal there. When I checked in I already knew I was in the right place at the right time. Still with a big smile on my face and a smile on my lips that say NO! I appreciate that some places treat their patients in a more threatening manner. Disappointed with the way things turned out but the best thing I can say is that this whole situation is concerning.
Negatief;It was my first time at this hospital, my family was there very helpful and I was taken care of a huge section of the abdomen before my second surgery. Nurses were helpful. Day Care was friendly and pleasant. The Nursing Assistant of my choice was very helpful. The Nursing Office was very nice too. The pharmacy was more of a pain in the fore arm as there were several that day when I was discharged. My discharge date was May 24, 2024. Nurse Assistants were:
Negatief;It was my first day here and I didn't think anything of it then heard the ambulance pulling up the stairs and I guess it's been three hours since I last saw them�t even though i have�t�t�t bothered to say no. Came back a day later to find it was probably too late. Went into the bathroom and there was the last person out at the door with them. I walked a couple more times until I finally got to the last door and closed it. Then, a paramedic started asking questions to which I knew nothing about. Then the last time I went into the room the last time they had even started asking questions. Didn�t the last second believe I should leave
Negatief;It was my first time doing a hospital run. I had some serious bleeding from my face which was horrible. I was also bleeding when I got transferred to this location for discharge. I have to say my ambulance was extremely nice. They sent me a 3 day post ab initio list with no nutrition info, so I didn�t know what was going on until I was ordered to have blood testing and nothing on my chart. My fluid status wasn�t checked until I was halfway through the 2 day stay. Also trying the VBAC line, which was bad. I felt like I wasn�t fully trained and didn�t know what I was getting into. After getting called I had no idea what was going on
Negatief;It was my first experience with this business, and it was never my intention to hurt anyone. They should never have to discharge patients after they raise a point regarding the discharge process. I will not stay here with patients who are asking for bloodwork and the staff is rude and abusive. I do not understand why people so vehemently believe this business will just 'fix' this situation. After I placed my order, they made a point of trying to arrange a 'discharge visit' but were turned away because of scheduling conflicts. Where is the care at safety point when there is no one around to 'discharge' and 'testify' on behalf of the patient? This is not a discharge, it is a 'test'-discharge' and
Negatief;My experience with the ED has been absolutely horrible. The nurses and techs are never helpful or patient enough to help people. The medication list and patient notes are extremely confusing each time. The nurses don�t answer simple questions! The doctor will not even tell you what's causing the issue. All in all a nightmare. Only thing I could get through was to go to the bathroom and find out what is causing the problem. After I did that, I had to talk to the nurse who proceeded to lie about how bad it is. It's so frustrating to be on medication and be told that I have no pain! Especially after seeing so many of their mistakes. Disappointed that the ED asked me to take another medicine but refuse to listen
Negatief;My experience with the tech team is great! They were great about coming by when I needed urgent care and did a stellar job. Very few rude questions. Did not take time for a mental breakdown because I am a huge tech fan and wanted to speed things over! Didn't receive phone call or e-mail from representative until I went to my desk. Didn�t take any time off from work as I needed more time to clean my room, prep my meal and prep for my appointment. Was extremely patient and helpful as I waited over a hour to be formally notified. After I waited over an hour everyone did a great job! My 2 minor complaints are the amount of notes I have to make in my desk (poor old dad sat there
Negatief;My experience with the nursing staff was one of the best. They would not shower me and never leave my room unattended. Even after they told me to, I still had to have my glasses on. After being waited over 25 mins the staff made me feel as if I was in for a nightmare. The nurses never showed up until I was over 45+ pounds. Not a day goes by that I don't come to the hospital room to find out they have me sitting in a cot waiting for them to start removing my glasses. The way I see it, Nurse Jackie's doing her due diligence and pulling up all the paperwork. It�s very disappointing that so many nurses treat me the way they have. It�s the
Negatief;My experience with the nurse was very confusing and confusing. I know it is not my first time visiting the hospital and the staff here is very experienced. People in the room accused me of being unprofessional, and rude. The nurse admitted she took an infrequent test, but did not report to the bathroom assignment until the nurse told her she did not have time for it. This leaves a lot of room for interpretation (in my experience).
Negatief;My experience with the Nursing campus was something that should have happened a far better way after getting in contact with Nurse Jackie. This campus is a horrible place to go and is in need of a manager. The administrators at Duke and the Nursing and Mental Health campuses both agreed to an independent review of the situation. I think Nurse Jackie needs to step down from the position she was in before she was placed on leave.
Negatief;Absolutely disgusting and terrible hospital! The staff was horrible and rude. All the nurses I spoke with were rude and didn�t listen to me. Every time I tried getting a blood test a patient waited almost an hour. Nurses were very judgmental and told me I had to go to another doctor's office to get paid for my prescriptions. They told me to stay home and wait more than a day to be signed up for a blood test. During my stay in an outside hospital they would not let me go check my room door since my wife was already there and waiting for her medication to be delivered. After I submitted the paperwork, they promised I would not be charged until my results came back. Only later did I realize that the actual
Negatief;Absolutely disgusting and terrible place to go. The nurses were very annoying. Even though I was an average student I loved the class they gave me. I waited almost three hours before my shift was scheduled for 9am because they had to deliver my child to 1am because the nurses were leaving too late. The food was horrible. I don. I went to the front desk hoping for a manager. No manager. Only nurse. The 20 minute wait went by so fast I almost missed the shift. The food was terrible but the prepackaged food was horrible. No one told me to put the order and the food was delivered in 30 minutes. I am still waiting for a manager so I can find a manager. The whole point of the place is
Negatief;Absolutely disgusting and terrible experience! I ended up being discharged after 19 days after being admitted to the hospital because I didn't have a pulse. During my stay at the hospital I came across a list of doctors that didn't seem to care. I told them I didn't care and that I don't know what the medical or social implications would be for my family, friends and hospitals. At first I was so appalled by my experience with this hospital that I turned to the social media site to find out what was going on. I went to the hospital's website to find out they didn't care and now have me blocking people on social media for not knowing anything. Horrible experience!!! I'm currently coming out of the hospital only to find out I
Negatief;Absolutely disgusting and terrible hospital! Especially the nurse who ignored patients for over 20 minutes! Then proceeded to lie about being discharged at the last minute, as if there weren't any other hospitals that were available and proceeded to lie about being here 24/7!! The worst. Terrible care and they told me they don't care and would close my home! Then when I asked for more, they began removing my clothes. Not caring about my health or safety at hand!
Negatief;Absolutely disgusting and terrible place to be and my only hope for home safety and well wishes are to be reunited with my wife and child in Columbus and Columbus, OH. I talked to the manager and he accused her of trying to stop the nurse from stopping them but instead of stopping them she stopped them at the first sign that she was about to stop them and began threatening to kill her husband and baby if he didn't back off or stop the nurse when she finally raised her hand. I guess the first step for everyone who gets stopped by a nurse who isn't trained on what's happening to them is for them to say 'it's okay, I don't care' and then for everyone to be so careless and unprofessional with their job they're
Negatief;My dad's doctor was very nice and helpful. My mom went to the hospital a few nights before surgery to deliver a baby, but didn't return until almost midnight. While the team at Cedars-Gent did a wonderful job getting my son well, his doctor still called an hour and a half before my surgery to notify him that his blood pressure was too low (and that a check in at midnight was probably necessary). A few more call after that, and he realized that his baby was in danger, which he did the heavy lifting of yanking out. Surgery ended up holding my son with a VBAC which needed to be adjusted and my IV came loose halfway in he was still at it. After a few more calls and a
Negatief;My dad's doctor was very nice. And a very fast librarian. He was kind and helpful. My mom has a major emotional disfigurement. She needs IV fluids and a IV in one arm. All while being constantly pressured to have fluids and a heart rate monitor. She is literally a living nightmare to listen to. I'm not against IVs - I did go to that doctor once before - and as far as she knows they were not effective. What she does not understand is how often i be pushed and how often i can still not get these results even after being pressured to have IV syringes in my arm. It's ridiculous how often i was pressured to have a heart rate monitor and no results. Not a problem for
Negatief;My dad's doctor was nice but he never showed up!!! After that he kept telling me his world of things - drug induced coma, heart surgery, surgery without discharge papers, no discharge papers and no communication from home regarding discharge papers. Had diarrhea, had severe abdominal pain with no fluids left. Had to go to an ambulance to find out I had kidney failure. Then one day came and he came to say he was still working on my dad's surgery but he had been discharged due to brain rejection because of an infection. Also had pneumonia and it seemed like my dad wasn't as healthy as possible
Negatief;My dad's doctor was great too too. I had a surgery that almost killed me. It has since been reinstated and my blood work has been excellent. The surgeon I had surgery on was a wonderful doctor to go along with. There is no question in my mind that he is a doctor I will be going to again. My other doctor will probably go along with him too.
Negatief;My dad's doctor was very nice. My friend's did a great job, they'll probably not be able to deliver my baby in time for the surgery due to an induced coma. My mom had three IV bags ready to go which she left at home. After the surgery, the IV bags were sitting on the table covered with napkins in an effort to get my fluids in. The doctor didn't seem to care and instead directed everyone else to wait in line the rest of the way to get an opinion. The surgery happened almost a week after my mom delivered and my dad was trying to process the results. My dad got the flu shot which made him forget if he was gonna have to wait that long and waited over an hour for a medicine
Negatief;I had to be transferred to the 4th floor surgery at Johns Hopkins to correct a minor hand ligament injury. The surgery was stressful. At first I was so very helpful and so pleasant. Then, the operation manager, Dr. Paul Fried, came to my room and asked me which orthopedic surgery I wanted to have. I told him I was already informed of the surgery and that my status was uncertain because of the stress hormone test results. What I didn't know was that since the room was so remote, there were no meds available! The manager requested a review as well and I agreed to do a medical exam. It actually took me 3+ hours to reach my old doctor and then a 2 hour drive home. My bill
Negatief;I had to be discharged from my job when it was set as an example for all employees not to discharge their staff and families members who work for a pay raise. Why is it a day late for a 3rd week of my 19 month stay on leave when my last assignment was 3/6? Why is my scheduling so frustrating? Where is my meal and drink list? Where are my notes for the scheduled testing needed? My car was stopped on July 19th, no transport being requested. Any further information concerning this case or any other follow up questions is requested asap.
Negatief;I had to be there for my pneumonia. My blood pressure was almost normal. My pulse rate was almost normal. But suddenly my temperature went up and my blood pressure went up. It took over an hour for my cardiology team to come to my room and remove my mask. After that it was over. They waited over an hour just to do a test to see what was wrong. I told them I had pneumonia, so they asked me to have surgery and had surgery after me. The plan was to have the fallopian tubes moved around and see if they could give me a sense of direction while I'm still alive. I told them I had a lot of work to do, so I guess I'm not getting far. Still hope for
Negatief;I had to be there 2 mins before the ambulance was scheduled to leave. At first I was so kind to the one I had called. I was greeted warmly by Nurse at the front desk greeting me. I understand there aren't many nurses in this hospital so let me have my say which room I was moved to. Nurses are usually the most helpful and caring. Tonight was my first time around Nurse was so kind to see me. Nurse greeted me first and after a few more questions asked if I was ok. Good to see here and good to go. Had to return 2 mins before they scheduled the ambulance for 2 mins wait to be able to leave. Came in for my crayon to clean room but otherwise no problem. Still
Negatief;I had to be hospitalized because I had severe dehydration and was dehydrated - very thirsty. Nurses there were nice but I think the only reason I ended up at this hospital was due to an overcharge on my card. I had to pay for a refill but the bill would not go to my bank. The card didn�t deliver and there were no results available for that card - no card refill. Discharge wouldn�t happen until I registered for the card and got my discharge papers. I didn�t care for the card at first - now that I know the hospital staff made a big mistake. At least that was my initial impression of the hospital.
Negatief;The quality of the lab was excellent. What was not great, however, was having to go to the restroom multiple times, for tests and treatments that were not available in the pharmacy. There have been reports of potential safety issues with the drug as well as other prescription medication being withheld which was frustrating for the doctors.
Negatief;The quality of the care is average and the patients in this hospital are very helpful. The medication order process is very well planned out so that all parties involved can return questions within 2 weeks. There is no duplication of care and no time for paperwork should a home pregnancy be withheld. The hospital's website only says that they are able to process 4,000 email attachments per day along with a database of over 36,000 address books. Patients discharge as quickly as possible along with all necessary hospital transport and approval. The hospital is also offering medication rehabilitation at no charge to anyone with questions.
Negatief;The quality of the hospital facility is very good and the nurses of the hospital were very professional when I went there. The only serious negative thing I heard was that the food and drink is usually ok. It wasn't until I came back that I understood why. It all comes down to good food, clean and organized. I don't know why anyone would go to such a terrible hospital but they were probably not as helpful as they should have been. I would highly recommend the food and drink. If you are in need of a meal, or need help getting help from someone who knows what they are doing, I highly suggest this food and drink. If you are in need of a painkiller, or have other prescription medication that you are not currently
Negatief;The quality of the hospital and the quality of care and facilities is among the worst in the state. The Nursing Director had a problem getting her discharge papers in a timely fashion. She had to wait over a month (not an hour! I worked at Nursing Academy for over 3 years) before she received her discharge papers. Every step of the way, the nurse never bothered to review the papers and never bothered to check them on time. The medication schedule was horrible. I made a petition to change the medication schedule so that I would have more control over my medication schedule when I became aware of the issue. The only way to keep my medication schedule the same is to change the medication. Also, I kept getting told that the hospital would give me a
Negatief;The quality of the hospital has been excellent with very few infections and very fast care and treatment. The pharmacy is in terrible condition with the results of radiation being negative. Do you want to be charged over $60 for radiation? The average bill is over $500 a day if you live in Florida.
Negatief;I am extremely disappointed by the product selection. It is disappointing that my daughter was not vaccinated. Long story short. My daughters case was transferred to the cardiology department for pneumonia and it was determined that this was the case of a preimmune infection. Hospital staff recommended that I prepare a flu vaccine and the results were in but since my daughter was not exposed to the infection she was not able to obtain the necessary flu vaccine and therefore can't be recommended for any use. The cardiology department advised me not to prepare the flu vaccine and instead notify the manufacturer but my daughter was advised to wait until her illness is more serious before determining whether the vaccine is needed or not. I am currently testing the flu vaccine and will update this post when I receive additional
Negatief;I am extremely disappointed in my experience with this pharmacy. I gave my prescription to see an experienced OB/GYN. When we visited she introduced herself as my mother and told me she was currently in the process of doing a blood work. Once we got to the counter, she proceeded to walk us to the bathroom which I entered through a front door. She proceeded to place our IV in her lap while she waited for me to finish my prescriptions. I went to the bathroom to find out my IV had been discharging. She went over to the counter and yelled for my IV to come out. I told her I don't know and that I do not have any information about her doing so and that I am more comfortable with her telling me the
Negatief;"I am extremely disappointed with this pharmacy. I received a prescription for Mylan at 1:00 a.m."", no time to discharge the patient. After waiting over an hour or two for discharge papers, I was greeted with a new phone number that would take no more than an hour to call me back. After I called back, I found out that Mylan was leaving because I didn. I've called over 50 times today and they still think it was me who discharged the patient. They told me I can't return uncharged prescription and that I have 20 days to request a review prior to my discharge. Patients have been calling and texting me asking if I care anymore and I refuse to answer. Patients feel pressured into being patient while at the"
Negatief;I am extremely disappointed with my experience with the pharmacy. The whole reason I went into the pharmacy was to get an MRI to see if I had any bleeding or a infection. After getting my MRI, I never even knew I had it. I called the doctor one time trying to find out if there was anything wrong with me. They would not budge and instead of doing another MRI, they charged me $55 and transferred me to another location with the additional $55 bill. I know the pharmacist probably didn't care but they charged me another $55 because it is so embarrassing. They charged me $75 because I said I needed a blood test! They made all the money up!
Negatief;I am extremely disappointed with my experience with the restroom at my daughter's first nursing home after we visited yesterday. We did not consider ourselves qualified or qualified to address the problem concerning the discharge of an unhygienic discharge patient. After seeing a doctor, it became clear that I was not qualified and that a discharge would be required in order to effectively discharge the patient. While the hospital is dedicated to caring for the needs of its patients, I remain extremely disappointed and disappointed that I was never qualified to address this issue. It takes a tremendous amount of courage to step forward and stand by and allow the worst to happen to someone who doesn't have the proper skills and motivation to do the job required of them. I am also extremely disappointed
Negatief;Great clinicians and nurses. Had my 12 yr old son taken to a hospital with multiple pulmonary problems and severe pain. While he received fluid and bloodwork he had to take because he was getting dehydrated the Hospital Staff told him to stop taking certain drugs and that his liver was failing. After 12 hrs of being told his liver was failing, doctors started to know something was wrong with him. The problem began when the Hospital Staff ordered fluids and blood work and started trying to control the situation. A few hours went by Hospital Staff came in and started trying to take control of the situation. At first they insisted that they remove the medication from the child but when they finally did remove it they didn't want him to have any fluid to drink from. This
Negatief;Great clinicians and nurses. Parking lot, long walk from home. Nurses leaving often, leaving patients at home without power for at least 3-4 hours before coming for treatment. Discharge portals often open at different times, often after hours. Emergency room can take a minute or two to close and some patients can be admitted for a few minutes. Patients are not trained enough to care for themselves or get medical attention, leaving patients without power over time. Terrible customer service. Stay away from the fast food restaurants and hospitals that serve food to patients. Discharge portals should not be used as an excuse to close down one of the world's largest and most effective health care facilities in the world.
Negatief;Great clinicians and nurses. I would highly recommend them to anyone considering a rehabilitation. This hospital was my first hospital visit and the one that offered the best care and the safest possible discharge. My discharge resulted in bad patient records. I would highly recommend the hospital to anyone who needs quality care and rehabilitation. I have no idea how bad this whole situation can get but should keep an eye out for what I can find.
Negatief;Great clinicians and nurses. A lot of the nurses are average but my wife went to the hospital with 36 hours to do 3 days, 1 was discharged and I needed blood work. I was so tired, I left the room (I had three hours of sleep) and went for the bathroom, nothing happened. I've never been to this far because of the awful way it was done, they made you lie on the exam table across from you and yelled at you for it to stop. After asking them to stop, they said they could stop for as many as 5 more minutes, leaving you with only your third exam lie across the bed. No bedside manner and very irritable. The way nurses told you this was the hospital way. I
Negatief;Great clinicians and nurses. I am very disappointed with the way the pharmacy performed their tests. The pharmacy records 20+ patients per day. Two thirds of them never visited a doctor. Nurses never talk to the patient and don�t answer any questions. Don�t serve them anything they don�t want them to know. Why did they do this? Did they even bother to download everything necessary to get the job done? Do they know what they are doing?! And worst of all... Why pay half a million dollars to care for someone who says they will not care.
Negatief;Informative instructors. Was suppose to be a business student and wanted to get started. It took a while to get my bearings and get my instructor's attention when I got there. I didn't want to go into too much detail here as I knew a lot of the people were here as well as staff. Was very nice and took a good seat. The hallway was never crowded and was surprisingly clean. I did a little laundry but it didn't change my mind about coming here. Had a nice time and ended up leaving very disappointed with the service delivery man I came across. Good job at Delivery House!!
Negatief;Informative instructors. Was suppose to get a 3rd class after their 5 pm class. I left and checked in at 5:45 pm, but had to take a 20 minute break to get my EKG test results ready for me to give the class a go. Once my test results are in, I should be seeing a doctor by the 1st Friday of each month. The instructor should tell me when she thinks she can start scheduling my class, when I should be seeing a doctor, when I should be supposed to return home, whether I'm supposed to return home or not. Didn�t make any effort to contact her last minute to say I appreciate the attention. Left unsupervised.
Negatief;Informative instructors. Was suppose to get a list of 25 people we actually had at meetups and info in case something went wrong. Didn�t get in. Had to show up at 2:45am, had 2 hours. Ended up in the front desk at 3:45:30. Didn�t talk to anyone until 5:30pm. Not able to start class until 1:45. Worst class I've had so far.
Negatief;Informative instructors. Was suppose to get my degree 3 weeks before my 1st month of teaching but instead of getting a certificate I was told I have to wait a month or two before I can get my 'work in the news'. Cool! Excellent!
Negatief;Informative instructors. Was suppose to be a first class member but didn�t get it. After being served with more than one assignment, I wanted to get a list of people who knew I was well-versed and comfortable working at a facility that was not affiliated with my school. I also wanted to know whether I would be able to obtain medical attention while I was in the process of getting discharged. The instructors made me feel pressured because I had been communicating well via e-mail about the procedure and needed it immediately. After being served with 30 days to obtain my discharge paper, I wanted someone who understood I was still fully qualified to work in the lab and would be able to schedule me the procedure itself if necessary (in my
Negatief;I understand that waiting is a pain and we hope you take care of yourself. However, the hospital staff at this time was absolutely terrible and rude. The nurse practitioner once again made a point of asking us if we are pregnant. I absolutely refuse to give a negative grade for anyone. She repeatedly insisted on getting into our vaginas and then proceeded to do so without even leaving a prescription. It was almost as if she wanted to humiliate the patient by calling her a bag of chips because of her poor English. Even after I accused the manager of being rude and of being unprofessional she never once attempted to remove the bag of chips and never once attempted to push me down. I do hope this is the start of a dialogue within The hospital concerning
Negatief;I understand that waiting for help from medical personnel can take a while and it could take some time or money (especially since the hospital itself costs a fortune) but it was beyond frustrating coming face to face with the medical staff. From what I understand, the ambulance driver (who is not a registered nurse ) didn't care for the patient well because doctors told him to go to another room or wait outside of his own home to deliver the medication via IV. Then the representative told him to wait on a different room, which didn't help either! Once again, there was no communication between doctors, nurses, and administrators of the other facilities allowing us to act as if we weren't trained and acted as if we were. I also understand that waiting for
Negatief;I understand that waiting for doctors would take a while, but why would they wait more than an hour to see me? Especially since my pain is so bad. It took my mom 48 hours to come home from an ER visit and she was so bothered by my pain that she put her hand on my arm and started to move it. I guess my experience with the pharmacy was supposed to be stressful because of the wait time, but instead I got so turned on by the attention and attention span that I had to give it a try. Not to mention the inconvenience of going to the doctor each time you encounter pain. After my 10 hour wait time I was finally on the phone with the rep and was told that the additional hour did not add up�
Negatief;I understand that waiting can be quite the challenging process, especially as it is stressful when you only have a limited amount of time to make arrangements. Especially since food and drink will be unavailable until 3:00 PM when the nurses and doctors leave. We appreciate that you are able to leave without having to go to the bathroom at noon to eat after a shift shift shift change can take a while to complete. However, do consider this a way to keep an eye on you as many hours go by as possible. It can be a stressful time trying to get dressed and ready for a shift, and also a stressful time waiting at the checkout line for a meal. The amount of time it took me to process the menu change from one place to another leaves
Negatief;I understand that waiting hours for a medical team is stressful but I find it frustrating and disheartening that so many time are put into an emotional and mental drain at the same time and the doctor has to carry on the stressful day. It is heartbreaking. Regardless if you are a good patient or a bad one I find it extremely frustrating.
Negatief;My mother was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a seizure induced coma. After initially agreeing to a seizure control schedule, she began experiencing an abnormally low blood sugar and was pressured into taking medication for a liver exam. Little by no other requests have been made. At first my mother did not believe that drugs would change her mind because of this neurologic finding. She initially raised the issue with her doctors and nurses, but they insisted on calling their trained nurses to check on her. After coming to realize that she was in a coma, doctors decided to wait and see if there was any medication she could get. Little did she know that on July 20, 2024, doctors had ordered a seizure control order for her. The next day, July 25,
Negatief;My mother was admitted at the hospital after being hit by a car while she was leaving class. The accident took place at 2:00 a.m., and we were at the hospital approximately 25 minutes after our scheduled shift ended. It is our second time here, and as such we are not�t at an optimal time for a minor to get hurt�re about to get discharged before the ambulance comes.� Therefore it�s desirable for us to know exactly when our shift will end in order to schedule it correctly and keep the classroom open. Housekeeping here does not come cheap. We paid $6,000 for our first floor, which is currently $900.�� Therefore with over $900 in savings
Negatief;My mother was admitted to The Johns Hopkins Hospital on 9/1 for pneumonia and was admitted the morning after. After doing a chest exam and seeing a c eo nurse, she went into labor August 24th at 5:30 PM. The doctors didn't care because she was getting very dehydrated (6 hours sitting still) and needed fluids. Therefore, they placed her on buprenorphine, a medication that reverses the effects of a previous drug. Before her labor, doctors told her that once they had given the drug to her, the drug didn't need to be stopped for labor - it could take any drug at any time and it wouldn't irritate the baby's heart (oh please!). As a result, they didn
Negatief;My mother was admitted to hospital without discharge papers, and two days later there was an urgent cardiac arrest. While discharging her discharge papers the nurses lied about being on call to report an unexpected patient being discharged. A nurse on duty just happened to be at work when someone on the other end of the hall came in asking for something they could not give. After several attempts they would never come back. I was so angry with my pharmacist and health care staff at this time that they took a step back and asked them not to add any more nurses. What a joke.
Negatief;My mother was admitted to the hospital with minor bruising to her chest. She was taking some pain medication and was in good spirits. At first we were very stunned and heartbroken at what had happened. The first thing we did was check the room. There wasn't one, nor was there any. All the patients rooms have televisiters. The nurses say it took 20 minutes for the room to start working. Then we have to go into it with a patient who has seen no nurses and still cannot make out his or her lips. The wait room is in the hallway between 2nd floor and 3rd floor. Little by little there is going to be more room for nurses to work. Little by way of explanation will be given about what
Negatief;Horrible experience!! Went to the Emergency department but they wouldn�t help me or my family at first and then would leave us feel unsafe without medical attention!! Had surgery which ended up causing chest pain and swelling for 24 hours! Hospital discharged within 24 hrs. Discharge was 2 day after my CT scan and discharge was 3 day after discharge. Discharge was 5 day after discharge. They waited over a year for my discharge paperwork that I never received!!! Horrible experience!!
Negatief;Horrible experience!! Went to the ER that morning and was greeted by�wait for it�poor doctor! I checked into the Hospital and was greeted by�poor nutrition man! I had to take a blood test and the results are currently in my desk drawer. Horrible experience! Horrible way to go, but probably will return to this location once more experience better nutrition is promised!
Negatief;Horrible experience!! Went to hospital to have IV in my hand and it took almost 24 hrs for it to fully discharge!! The nurses there were so patient!! They were nice but there was never any'surgery' required!! The only complaint I have is for the food!! I got two cups of hot sauce. Only thing good about this location is that the wait staff was nice - they waited almost 4 hours!! They also left out some questions to answer and waited over an hour for the food to arrive!!! After they finally did they left out the 2nd question that I asked for...oh wait... nothing! I had 2 people that were so nice. They even waited over an hour for the food to be ready! Someone else was waiting
Negatief;Horrible experience!! Went to see 3 doctors immediately. The first doctor had no idea I had a heart condition and a medication that is effective only for the heart condition. They left my 3 day CT and told me to stop taking the medication because I had an abnormally large and almost painful jugular. I refused the cardiology and did a heart bypass surgery. They told me I had to stay home and wait an additional 48 hours. 24 hrs went by and my doctors did the surgery. 48 HOURS. I keep telling them the surgery was a good thing as I felt better, but they left me with a nasty abdominal pain. Then they told me there was nothing they could do without me. And don't even get me started on medication
Negatief;Horrible experience!! Went to the nurse's office where I was admitted after being transferred to bed with serious bleeding on my hand and back. They weren't very kind to me and I ended up with swollen membranes all over my hand, chest and arm. I was getting tests done before my discharge and they weren't very helpful at all. Horrible experience. Went to tech office and waited 24 hrs to get info on my IV line up. I knew I had to get a biopsy done but went ahead and waited 48 hrs before getting involved in anything. Called tech today and was told there was a problem. No one came. Then there was a nurse waiting for me in the waiting room. Once that was confirmed there was nothing wrong with me
Negatief;The fact that I'm still coping with the stressful situation is almost repulsive. The doctors can't even come close to asking for a blood test because my test results are in their hands. I literally go to the ER every day to make sure they don't find something wrong with me. They keep asking me questions like how long I've been in this room, how long I've slept there, and how far along I am on my medication. The manager never bothered stopping by because they asked me if I had any questions about the medication or any way I can help them out. I'm still so scared to go to the doctor because they don't even bother to check my room floor because I'm so tired from the stress. Do they need
Negatief;The fact that I'm in this profession and receive crap grades is completely shocking to us people. The only thing better than being called a horrible profession is being told that way because you put so much work into something that is otherwise ok. Not caring about the actual jobs you are supposed to perform. Especially considering you didn�t add anything to improve your social status. When I say 'good' I don�t even mean that everything that gets done is good. I mean if it�s gonna make progress for me then it�s gonna add up. I really want someone who is more considerate to the profession and caring for their fellow worker(s). Disgusting how the world treats people like this.
Negatief;The fact that I'm alive is shocking. I waited over a week to get medical attention after a fall that left me with multiple deep paresis and a swollen perforated perforated perforated perforated perforated perforation that was causing pain as well as discomfort. My doctors recommended 3x IV antibiotics, 3x percutaneous catheterization, a intubation within the peritoneum and IV antibiotics. I signed up for the Surgery on August 25th, and got results in just over a week. However, over the weekend I was told I could not make a surgical percutaneous perforus until the end of my stay because there were so many fluid problems. This turned into a labor and
Negatief;The fact that I'm supposed to be given the worst health care possible is concerning. I come from a family that was literally destroyed during the war. During my time there my father, step-grandfather, step-nephew, and step-son were infected with various deadly and nasty diseases which can keep you sick for up to 20/30 days. After that no one knows how bad the illness is or how bad it can get. It has gotten to the point where the doctors don't want them to know. Especially after being here for more than an hour. It can get so bad that the nurse can't even start the infusion and that takes for hours just to get the medicine out. My doctor says it took 2 hours over
Negatief;The fact that I'm being kept in an abusive situation does not come as a surprise nor does it come as a surprise to anyone that comes into my door asking for my number. I have been in a lot of different hospitals over the years, and all of them were horrible. I went into the Johns Hopkins hospital, they had a whole lot going on with the flu and pneumonia, and there was one doctor at all. I never saw anyone. She went in and told me to leave, I knew she was lying and I just wanted someone to talk to. They told her they already know who I am, that they'll care for me. They didn't do a better job at their jobs, didn't hire me nor remove me from the
Negatief;Unorganized, some of the people never left until I did. Went to the doctor when there was a 1:30 PM CT call asking if I would have any fluids or blood tests at the last minute. I admitted I had a fluid addrena in the IV on 3rd floor of the medical building and never bothered asking if it was working. He kept threatening to leave me there with too many fluids on me. My last straw was when my doctor sent me home with my IV in fluid form and the threatening IV in liquid form in a EKG. Unprofessional nurse, rude and uninterested kept trying to reach over to my bed and tell her she could leave me alone and I would never see her again.
Negatief;Unorganized, some of the people weren't nice and did a terrible job of communicating effectively with us, we have a special friend who is a nurse. Not to mention the fact that we are in the midst of a major surgery that will take several weeks to complete. This surgery has started around noon because of the bad news that the ED was unavailable until 3:00 PM and we had to wait over an hour. Not to mention everyone here knew the location and time to call (which we had no idea). They keep telling us if the operation is possible we can wait well into the night or they can take us out at any time. Regardless of what your reason for getting hurt, get out there, work and get ready for surgery! They
Negatief;Unorganized, some of the nurses who were there were rude. The waiters were rude with a dollop of food on their lap. A friend of mine brought a jar of canteen paper that they had to post in her room to help her keep track of her medication. The RN said she needs to bring along a computer and app that are very hard to find. She says she needs that help from the pharmacist who is on campus. Nurse 1: Good morning. Nurse 2: Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Nurse 3: Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning.
Negatief;Unorganized, some of the staff was rude, the cook was rude and the pharmacy didn�t deliver the medicine until I requested it. Very disappointing experience
Negatief;Unorganized, some of the instructors didn't say a thing. I worked from 9:00 until noon. At that time, I left my address book at home and went to the desk where I started to check the email from my friend. Once she left, I had to wait at least an hour for the download to be sent. I checked the email at least three times but never got it. The worst thing about this hospital is their food! All in all, when I walked into the hospital I loved it! The nurses were average but the clean up job was a hit and miss. I will not go into the hospital again. They treat me like crap and disregard my health. I worked 20+ hours a week as an ED nurse
Negatief;If i could give my cat food i do�t. Especially the dehydrated cat food. She is a pain in the chest, stomach and in the lungs. And the dehydrated food was bad news. Every time i got to the hospital i had to eat a meal that had the wrong ingredients and wasn�t ready for bed. And of course every time i bring home the wrong meal i receive an unexpected food file. And in my letter to the hospital i assured them i would give the proper amount and that i would give them the cat food if they asked. Well that�s about it. The bad news is that at least they were supposed to deliver the proper food to me a second time because i�m
Negatief;If i could give up my baby i would. i had 12 months to live before surgery and was trying to get discharged from the hospital because it was blocking my way to delivery due to a uterine infection. due to this the hospital gave me a prescription for IV antibiotics. The doctor also refused to let me have my baby, as i was still trying to get my discharge papers and was still trying to get IV feeding glasses ready. at this point i knew i had a serious problem. not to mention the stressful experience trying for discharge papers! when you get discharged from the hospital you are supposed to get everything ready for surgery. and at that point i realized i had a huge problem: no OBGYN!!! when i entered the room there were
Negatief;If i could give a 1 star, I would! A few other reviewers called and said they wanted a doctor to review their son before they ordered anything else. The doctor wanted to know what kind of blood tests the drug was currently being given, what blood tests were being withheld or was the drug still effective beyond what was stated on the package. After being called a few times out of the way and getting extremely frustrated, I agreed to go to the doctor because they seem to think they care about the health of their patients more than the patient. Regardless, I want the doctor to make sure there are no mistakes made and they'll start over again. I know I'll never be able to get this medication back whether it comes from a different manufacturer or
Negatief;If i could give my baby a diagnosis i do. He has epilepsy which results in seizures lasting almost 3-5 days or more, some periods of epilepsy worsening. The treatment does not work. My wife and I wanted him to get an MRI and the CT scans to find out what is causing his epilepsy so he can stop taking the medication at any time. The doctors told me he has epilepsy and medication can't work. Terrible, wouldn't put it off. Do Not Call!
Negatief;If i could give one star i do and i will give it 5 stars because i did a terrible job at my job as an RN! I went to the dentist to get intubation. He told me to eat lunch and bedding i already had because i didn't eat well yesterday. The nurses left me there for 3+ hours. Two hours went by, no one showed up at the shift. I called the bell at 7:30 PM. It took a whole hour for anyone to come. All the nurses left. I went to the bathroom, put on a mask and yelled at the door. The nurse yelled at me to leave. I started bleeding and kept asking for aid. The nurse put me on IV all the way to
Negatief;I�m beyond disappointed in my experience with Allstate. This is the worst major hospital I have ever been to in my life. They have such a horrible safety record, I was moved to a 2nd floor hallway away from my loved one for discharge which is terrible. Discharge patients come in from out of town to find out they have an illness that is causing them to stay up late. Ridiculously rude staff! Also, Allstate Nurses make up for it by not caring if you're sick or alive!! I would highly recommit to a better hospital experience
Negatief;I�m beyond disappointed in this hospital. Terrible communication with nurses, nurse practitioners and caterers when I was patient was over 60% with a flu but no fluids available at discharge without follow up testing. The patient had surgery scheduled for July 4th and discharge due July 9th, did not be seen until July 25th which obviously didn�t look good. When they started getting more patient I kept asking for fluids and they would not give me any. Horrific situation when a representative from Hospital 1 day later said they would not process my medication until my cardiology testing was complete. Terrible communication between nurses, caterers and phone numbers. I hope IV bags are available from July 19th to 25th to
Negatief;I�m beyond disappointed in my experience with the doctor! While I highly appreciate the medical attention that was given, my son was never able to donate any kidney. Surgery was performed incorrectly and unnecessary. After surgery, he received fluid and fluids for testing and treatment. While I appreciate that doctors are trained and qualified, it�s disappointing that I didn�t receive the necessary vaccinations at the first try. After receiving the necessary medication, my son had fluid and fluid for testing and treatment and is currently nursing at home, so he is not available for any additional tests.
Negatief;I�m beyond disappointed in my sample! I had a 2nd sample sent to my lab today and did a complete discharge which revealed my diagnosis of an Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). This diagnosis is major news to me! I believe the surgery was performed incorrectly (it took place between August 1st 2013 and July 31st 2013 while I was in the United States) and my results�tinted correctly. The surgery was to correct my initial diagnosis of pain and I have a medical condition called Rheumatoid Arthritis. Surgery and discharge is nothing new! I currently have 2 options when it comes to surgery: Surgery alone�s not enough power and I believe the surgery to correct my initial diagnosis is beyond
Negatief;I�m beyond disappointed in my second time here! It�s been over a month since I started my shop. They seem to forget to update my phone number and email address. They forget to set up transfers for me and my child. I can�t find my doctor appointment online or send it tomorrow. My wife and I are living far from each other due to the heavy traffic. The manager can't even get up to speed on where my child is. The customer service rep says she can�t deliver my baby on time unless I tell them I have an urgent need. I keep getting asked questions that make me feel as though I'm trying to answer them. It�s embarrassing. All in all,
