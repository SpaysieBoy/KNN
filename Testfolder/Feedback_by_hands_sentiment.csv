Sentiment,Review
Positief,"""I have been to a number of hospitals (unfortunately) and have been impressed with The Hospital. It is a very good facility, with multiple floors for cardiology (and other floors for other areas too). I have been engaged mostly with the Advanced Heart Failure team and they are the best to deal with. Every single nurse, doctor, APRN has been outstanding. I tell them that I have been to other hospitals and those other hospitals are great, but when compared to The Hospital, it is like comparing Chik-fil-a to McDonald’s. They are just a cut above in service and making you feel cared for. I had to have a long stay and they have a spa (Eden Spa). I was able to schedule a haircut in my room. So convenient and adds to your own humanity when you take care of the basics."","
Positief,"""All I can say is excellent. I was transferred to there after having stomach pain due to a gallbladder issue and had a procedure done. The Doctor was the surgeon and very good. All the doctors and nurses and staff took really good care of me during my stay. I had a beautiful clean private room on the 12th floor with a beautiful view of the city. Their services were more then 5 stars. Each staff for each shift was excellent. Thank you for all that you do."","
Positief,"""My stepson had to be direct admitted to the epilepsy center and we stay for two nights. They moved really fast to get him seen. The Doctor the resident has a great bedside manner and listened ti our full history. Her supervisor, Doctor Mariah seemed sincere and listened too. The Doctor was able to finally give him a diagnosis and get our son on a good track. Kristen, the night nursing was wonderful. Millie the EEG tech were made him feel comfortable and took her time with him. Even had to redo it leads. The room was large and clean. It was nice having the resource center for snacks and miscellaneous things we didn’t pack. Only complaint would be the techs or were a little loud in the hallways with each others. Didn’t see them too much."","
Positief,"""I’ve had a consistently positive experience with The Hospital, and it’s one of the reasons I switched most of my healthcare providers to them. The care from both the doctors and staff has always been exceptional. I’ve had various procedures done, including X-rays, sonograms, and MRIs, and each time the process has been smooth, professional, and efficient. I’ve visited several of their locations, and it’s clear that the high level of care is consistent across the board. It’s comforting to know that I can rely on The Hospital for quality medical services no matter where I go."","
Positief,"""I like to thank all the staff for taking care of me. I was admitted there for a gallbladder removal and stayed 4 days. During the stay each nurse and staff on all shifts were so great taking care of me. Thank you to Doctor for visiting and taking care of my gallbladder removal. If I could give more then 5 Stars I would. I had my own room and the floor was very quiet. I was on the 12th floor and had a beautiful view of the city. Thank you again for taking care of me. Here are a few photos of the view from my bed in my hospital room on the 12th floor"","
Positief,"""Open heart surgery and recovery. ICU team was Awesome!!!!!! 8th floor Cardiology folks were top notch as well. Doctor and his support cast were Outstanding!!!!!!!! Highly recommend this facility!!!!!!!!!"","
Positief,"""My procedure went well. My anesthesiologist, did however give me too much medicine and it took me 3-4 hours at least to come out of it. I was dizzy for hours. I was not happy about that. But my doctor , Doctor was amazing . I would recommend him to everyone."","
Positief,"""Such an exceptional experience. So impressed with the care given to a small child to ensure it is not traumatic. Every nurse, doctor, and technician was pleasant, friendly, and helpful. Taking the time to explain every detail of the procedure. Thank you so much for taking the stress away."","
Positief,"""It was a very good experience. The staff was amazing from registration to all the nurses.. they were very thoughtful and kind and explained everything in a clear way. The Doctor was great and took his time with me.The Doctor is a wonderful Doctor and I highly recommend him."","
Positief,"""I have trusted The Hospital to care for me for more than five years and, before that, I trusted Florida Hospital for over twenty years. Every encounter that I have had with them has been positive. Every staff member: Doctors, Nurse Practitioners, Nurses, Technicians, scheduling, reception, transport team members and any other staff have been extremely warm, caring and sensitive to my needs. I don't think that I will entrust my well-being and medical needs to anyone else."","
Negatief,"""I went in for a accident check. I was in pain from a car accident I wanted to get checked out. I told the doctor and staff what my problems where. I don't think I was taken to serious and don't think I'll be back. I've been in this ER before and it was a lot better than this. The staff really needs to mind there own business and stick to there jobs and not make judgement on the client. At any rate unless I have absolutely no other choice I will not be back. Regardless of what profession the medical field is still a business and the hospital is not a charity. You get paid to do your job and keep you opinion to your self."","
Positief,"""I want to express my deepest gratitude to the hospice nurses and staff who cared for my mother during her final days from November 4 11, 2024. The care and compassion they provided were beyond words. Not only did they ensure her comfort and dignity, but they also took the time to educate me and offer emotional support throughout this difficult time. Their kindness, patience, and professionalism helped us navigate her final days with peace of mind. I will forever be grateful for the comfort, reassurance, and genuine care they provided to both my mother and our family. Thank you for making a truly difficult time a little easier to bare."","
Negatief,"""Can't find my friend! I have a friend who was admitted to this hospital via Emergency Care yesterday morning. I have been calling repeatedly and put on hold for over an hourtrying to find out his status whether he's alive or dead I still don't know! Why can't they add a patient directory to the website so that you can check it out without tying up all the phone lines? This is otherwise a very good hospital but this is a terrible omission and needs to be fixed asap"","
Positief,"""Everyone on the staff were so helpful, polite, and friendly. I felt like a person, not a number or a burden. It made my recovery so much quicker."","
Positief,"""We traveled from 5 states away and arrived at 1 a.m. We were greeted with smiles and led to my Mother-in-Laws room. My fiance and I were BOTH allowed to stay overnight with her in her room! I've NEVER heard of a hospital allowing more than one person to sleep before. It felt more like an upscale hotel, with a kitchen and family game room right next door. To top it off, the adjoied parking garage is free. Everyone was kind, courteous, and accomodating. Would highly recommend. I'd come here myself, if I didn't live so far away. Top Notch!"","
Negatief,"""If you are admitted to the hospital, it’s probably the worst thing that can happen to you. They treat you like crap! They forget to do their rounds and are off on needed medication. Especially for pain. The nutrition people who come in are extremely rude. And the pharmacy accused me of already having my prescription at discharge when I didn’t and told me there was nothing they could do. The manager told me to leave and go check my room which I knew they didn’t deliver it to me. All for them to deliver my medication to the wrong nurse and patient! Someone else had signed for my medication. I end up getting it back. And they just handed it to me with no apology on their mistakes or how they treated me. I have called and left messages for upper management at pharmacy in regards to this incident. No one called back. I even called patient relations and left a message. No one called back. I will NEVER deal with the hospital again for future care."","
Positief,"""My mom has been in the hospital after a fall for more than a week, because they’re not qualified (meaning they are bad at their job) to find her either a rehabilitation nor a skilled nursing facility. Case managers at the hospital change daily, have talked with 3 different ones, and they don’t know what they are doing. Asked for a list of facilities with a broader distance. Didn’t get it. Asked for the approved list of facilities with the broader radius distance, got the old on with the smaller radius distance. Selected 2 of those facilities, get a call the day after, a new case worker. She didn’t have access to my selection. She calls and tells me a rehab place came to see your mom and they can take care of her, it should take 2 days to get her in there. At the 3rd day talked with a new case worker, he “talked” with facility should get answer following day. I told him ok, you’re gonna call me back tomorrow. And if she not accepted then get her somewhere else. I don’t want her to be at the hospital. One week later and they keep saying “the insurance hasn’t approved yet”. My mom has been talking with insurance and they say that it has been approved already. Super unprofessional/incompetent and thieves."","
Negatief,"""I’m beyond disappointed in this pharmacy. There have been three times now that I have come to this location to place my refill order well in advance and told a time to come, but when I arrive at the given time, it is never ready—not even worked on. I was told I have to wait an additional 20 minutes, and that 20 minutes turns into 45 to 60. They are so unapologetic about the inconvenience. I would use a different pharmacy, but my child has to get a liquid form of the prescription, and the other does not carry it."","
Positief,"""I don’t have enough words to thank you all the staff at The Hospital. I had an amazing experiencing during my labor and delivery.Nichole Ramirez, Mistee and Jenny made me felt comfortable, happy and safe during the whole process.Thank you for the amazing teamwork."","
Positief,"""My husband had spine surgery at The Hospital this past week. I cannot say enough wonderful words of appreciation about the staff. From Martin, who checked us in, to the kind and thoughtful pre-op nurses and techs, to the neurosurgeon, Doctor, to the recovery team, to the tenth floor nursing and tech staff, Tad, Candace, Brett and Michelle. Along with the physical therapists that brightened my husband's day as he walked through the halls, pain free. I also don't want to forget the evening team, Alyssa and Mary. When I arrived to see my husband after his first night he was cheerful and so thankful for the staff at The Hospital, and the Neuro Unit. We are home now and his recovery has been super, with various calls from The hospital to assure he is comfortable and healing. We are forever grateful for this hospital that truly shows they care, not only for the patient, but for the family as well. Thank you The Hospital!"","
Positief,"""My mother was admitted with pneumonia and has got congestive heart failure, and only 25% of her heart working and a cardiology consult was requested. It’s been over 48 hours and not one cardiologist has bothered coming to see her. I guess it’s more important for them to have their Christmas parties or Parties with their buddies. I guess a patient with a 50% or 75% or 100% working hard is more important 25% working heart absolutely ridiculous. Stay away from the cardiology department as far as possible."","
Negatief,"""Great nursing staff but the process of the medical team is very frustrating and stressful. Were not considerate to situation in communicating effectively and made things more stressful. After getting bad news we had to wait over 4 hours to be formally discharged after being tired on 3 hours sleep, 1 meal, and now coping with an emotional and mental letdown made it harder then having to drive home irritable fatigued was an awful way to end a bad day:-("","
Positief,"""The Hospital Exceeded my Expectations. The hospital is very thorough and a patients health is #1. The staff was also very compassionate, Understanding, and transparent. They also set me up for follow up appointments regarding additional care. Highly, Highly recommend The Hospital."","
Positief,"""It was my first post-op visit with a Doctor. I was pleased that I did not have a long wait to be called into the office. The nurse who took my vital signs was extra friendly and conscientious. I was asked questions by the post-op nurse if I had any problems or questions as she went over the instructions to keep my operating site clean as well as showing great concern for my well-being. Dr. Holloway was pleased with my condition and answered some of my questions."","
Positief,"""Surgical team was amazing!!! Once I got to my room things were a little different. Some of my nurses were amazing where others were slow to assist me. I can't remember all the names, but I do remember TY which I am sure it is short for something. I wish I could remember the other nurse that stood out to me, but my apologies to her. There was also one tech that stood out for me and her name was Ethel. She was absolutely amazing she deserves many props. I guess all in all it was a good experience. Ty to the whole staff for making my stay as comfortable as possible "","
Positief,"""I had to be there at 12:30 for MRIs scheduled at 2:00. I never even got called back until 1:45. Then my MRI didn’t start until 3:00. Ridiculous scheduling! The nurses were very nice though which is why I gave a 2 rating. Didn’t care for the anesthesiologist. No bedside manner!"","
Positief,"""I have been inpatient 3 times in less than a month and each stay I have been treated with so much respect I am kind of shocked. I cannot say enough good things about the nurses that come in to take care of you! They truly are the backbone to the operation and will answer any and all questions you have. The patient portal has a really awesome feature while you are inpatient that allows you to follow all your care and testing in real time so you aren't waiting for someone to come tell you results or stuff like that. For someone that has been following her testing, it's so great to get the results on my own devices where I can see how things are going and can come up with questions before the doctors come in to visit making things so much more efficient. I definitely recommend going here but, you might need to wait a while to be seen if you go through the ER."","
Positief,"""This review is to explain briefly the professional care I received from the PA, Areeba Meraj, I must say that I were very blessed to have her take care of my medical needs in the ER on Tuesday Jan 14th 2005.I were in lots of sever pain and she comforted me with her care and kindness just as well as the healing of the ministry of Christ. Areeba followed up with my care in the hospital just as if I were her father. She will be a fantastic asset to this organization. May God bless her with the great skills she possess. Thank you."","
Positief,"""In general the service at the hospital was very good. Once discharged it was/is abysmal. The whole reason for going into the hospital was to get additional blood tests and a 2nd liver biopsy. Zero communication regarding results or a working diagnosis has taken place from any doctor since my discharge."","
Positief,"""Everyone we meet are wonderful! From Linnette at the info desk to every person in radiology and recovery; they are absolutely beautiful people who are a great representation of The Hospital. They all ask if we need anything, have questions, if we're OK, if we're hungry etc.. just incredibly fabulous people. A true blessing."","
Positief,"""The surgical team and post surgery team on the 1st floor are awesome! They kept us aware of everything step by step. As we moved up to the 8th floor the information and level of care stopped with the first nurse. Then Kristen came to us and knocked it out of the park. She stayed on top of all the meds and if something was not clear she got the answers."","
Negatief,"""This is my first time going with The hospital and have been highly disappointed with their phone service. Called for CT results and each time, there is no greeting, no introduction. They make you feel as if you’re distrusting their time. Horrible customer service. With The Hospital my test results are in MyChart same day. It’s been 3 day post CT exam with nothing on MyChart. The rude representative told me to wait over a week. Worst call service customer service ever!!!!! and I know good service. I worked call center for 4+ years. Very disappointing"","
Positief,"""This was my first experience as a patient at your hospital. I am an RN myself and tend to be very critical, however, I had the best care anyone could have. Everyone explained everything to me, was very kind, thoughtful and professional. Everyone, transport team, registration office, OR staff, nurses and doctors all provided top notch care."","
Neutraal,"""I was there yesterday for a work assignment. The parking options were very challenging. It took me 45 minutes to find a parking spot. I checked into the Rapid in/out surgery Dept. 1500 and clearly introduced myself. Then waited almost 3 hours with the patient. Long story short, It turned out my services weren't needed. What I don't understand is why 2 Nurse's I talked to were so rude to me. The gentleman who I checked in with tried to help but he was stunned too. It was unnecessary and embarrassing."","
Positief,"""Great clinicians and nurses. Excellent facility. Only complaint is the continuity of care and discharge process. Every step is linear - one at a time - resulting in extreme delay of discharge. As a pharmacist of 36 years I was able to act as my own discharge planner and arrange my home infusion and discharge in a more timely fashion otherwise I would have spent at least 2 more days just waiting for something to happen. Also the hospitalists weren’t very helpful and wouldn’t do anything without the pulmonary teams approval."","
Positief,"""I had a fabulous experience. Dr. Cory Hartman is the best neurosurgeon. The nursing and allied staff were great -- very attentive. I received near-hourly nurse rounding and daily nurse leader rounding. The food was good too. I have no complaints and only compliments."","
Positief,"""Surgery and Dr Yang were wonderful and the all went perfect and my husband has recovered very well especially for 93. The only thing was he was not given any heart medications the morning after the surgery and when we got home I almost took to ER because of heart pressure and heavy legs. I got a nitro patch on him and his night time Entresto and things calmed down and he has been fine ever since. Just don’t know why they neglected to give meds in the morning. Only antibiotics."","
Positief,"""Being in need of care and find a team of caregivers that take care of you with respect and attention of details is priceless. From the surgeon team, to the ICU,then to the nurses and their helpers everyone doing their part have made my experience memorable. Thank you all very much"","
Positief,"""My son was in this hospital for the week during a hurricane. The staff on the 9th floor was wonderful! Rachel was efficient and very helpful. Sarah took time to get us acquainted with our room. The food was not always great, however, the eggplant Parmesan and spanakopita was very tasty. The auxiliary services like PET, MRI, and EEG didn’t always communicate very well with the nurse or patient. The hospital feels a little disjointed. The staff works hard though"","
Positief,"""I have mixed feelings regarding my experience here at The Hospital labor and delivery. I went to the OB ED and got admitted. The RN that took care of me was a doll , so nice, attentive , caring and kind! Then I was transferred to labor and delivery 3rd floor, I had 2 nurses and they were so nice too. I was trying for a VBAC , unfortunately that didn’t work for me and I had to have a repeat c section. My c section wasn’t the most pleasant per say. I had a spinal anesthesia and I believe the CRNA student was the one trying and she attempted the spinal needle 3 times. I suffered so much , I was crying and begging for mercy as I felt so much pain! Pressure , pain, it was excruciating. Then finally the CRNA I believe came and did it. I still could feel sharp as she touched me with something and they decided to do a trenderbeg position (?) and put my head down and legs up, to “spread” the anesthesia. I told them I could still feel and they said “it’s just pressure”. When the cesarean surgery started I could feel the pressure and discomfort , they were stirring my belly up and I felt the movement with pain and I wasn’t comfortable. I then felt a severe pain on my back, for which they gave me more medication… I had a previous c section where I didn’t feel NOTHING during the surgery and my anesthesia was a breeze too. This time unfortunately it wasn’t the case. I would like to say tho, that my OR nurse , her name is Angel, she was indeed an angel. She was so supportive. She recorded my labor as I was alone, she took so many pictures , she was so nice - my baby took a while to come to me , in my head hours lol but maybe 10 minutes or so but it felt like an eternity! And then I went to PACU. My stay was good overall ! Just the anesthesia part that messed me up real good. The other downside is I didn’t have the support of a lactation consultant , she came and stayed for 15 minutes and left but didn’t teach much and just said she would be back but never did . I only saw one for 15 minutes and I felt unsupported and left without help with breastfeeding"","
Positief,"""My mom was admitted about 8 days ago and since then she has have an amazing care team working on her case 24/7. I love this hospital and it staff is great. Thank you to all the amazing nurses and techs who have been assigned and taken care of my beautiful mom. The physical therapists in the ER. I highly recommended this hospital for you or any member of your family. The place is gorgeous and everyone is so friendly and welcoming. I am really grateful to our God Jehova for allow me to bring my mom to this facility. 1000% recommended!!"","
Positief,"""I had to have my right kidney removed. I was scared very nervous. I was on the 12th floor & I had the best nurses & other staff I have ever had. They were caring & anything to make feel better. 3 even came in at 1am singing happy birthday to me & giving me an ice cream bar. They were all wond"","
Negatief,"""My dad's doctor was excellent, the nurses too. But the Drop off and Pick up area for patients is an area that is completely disorganized and without safety for them. It's not the first time we've been here. I just hope that NOBOBY, never gets hurt!"","
Positief,"""Took good care of me after surgery. Nurse Kaitlyn was wonderful. Most of the rest of the nurses and techs were great. A few of the younger nurses assistants were not as trained and helpful as possible. A few seemed uninterested. And lastly, the food was terrible! The worst my wife and I ever experienced in more than a few trips to various hospitals over the years."","
Positief,"""The hospital is the best hospital! The doctors, nurses and staff are friendly, helpful, and supportive to your well being as a whole. They ensured I was informed of what was going on with my recovery. You are treated with dignity and respect with a little tough love if needed."","
Positief,"""This was my second time here. They did my oldest son’s surgery. I thought they did such a great job, that I decided to bring my youngest son here as well. I love how kind, caring, and detailed all the staff were. Surgery had me pretty shook considering my youngest was almost ten months. He was in and out relatively quick and within their timeframe. Doctor Keating does great work and shows great care each time."","
Positief,"""Super compassion and caring , friendly staff.. Each staff member treats you with with respect, care and a smile. They have such a good team; they make healing a safe and secure feeling. Bringing their knowledge, compassion , ppsitive vibes, sense of ease, and friendly smiling faces the whole way through. Ringing the bell is not only my persnal goal. I feel it's the care of each of their goals for me as well. It's great to have a winning team to fight this battle with ! I totally adore each staff member, Dr., nurse, nurse aid, receptionist , the list is long.. "","
Negatief,"""The fact that I'm leaving a negative review is heartbreaking because my baby was delivered here. Coming in, I was advised to be induced. After agreeing, I didn't know I would be pressured into taking so many drugs. My last straw was when i was offered Patostan to speed up my labor even tho I was already 5 centimeters dialeted after 10 hours. I denied it 5x before they started threatening C-section. After I agreed, I wanted a doctor to check me first to see how far along I was. They started to prepare the Iv for the drug and realized it was not placed correctly because I was in pain. While working to get my iv changed. The other nurse came to check on me and confirmed i was ready to push. Smh, so I didn't even need the damn drug. Yet I wasn't given an apology. My baby was born, and I gave out gifts to the nurses I felt did a great job with me. After a couple of days, my arm where the IV was placed brushed up badly. And now, 6 weeks later , my risk is still in pain . I can't even burp my baby with that hand. I may seek legal assistance and file a complaint."","
Positief,"""Great experience from check-in the morning of surgery, all the way to recovery. The nursing staff the anesthesiologist and the doctor all came in before the procedure with such positive energy. It was great to be a person and not a number coming from a nurse that means a lot."","
Positief,"""After waiting 17 hours for a scheduled surgery, I was finally on the operating table, catheterized, anesthetized, intubated and a huge IV in my jugular. Then the surgery was stopped. At first we were told it was because a TEE exam raised the question that I didn’t need surgery at this time. The surgeon came out several times to try to get my wife to say stop the surgery, but she kept asking the surgeon if after 17 hours he was still good to operate. He repeatedly said he and his team were good to go. After the third time, he advised he was stopping for safety reasons due to the long day. I woke up the next day in pain with the IV still in my neck. I spoke with several other doctors and received several different and conflicting diagnosis. I asked if I could go home, but was not allowed to leave until Monday afternoon, when I was told to go to another hospital and get a second opinion."","
Positief,"""I had a televisit which went ok except my test scans were not available for the practitioner to review. I had to download the report from Health First and email it during the visit. I made a point of messaging two weeks before my appointment and was assured the test results were available. There is a major issue between Heath First and The hospital portals."","
Negatief,"""Unfortunately I can’t give a 5 star to The Hospital due to a very poor follow up (pos surgery).I was supposed to have a follow up call from my doctors office to schedule a day for the catheter removal a day after my surgery, no one never bothered to call to make sure I was ok. Surgery was performed 3 days ago and I am still left in the dark in regards to my visit to remove this awful catheter that is causing so much discomfort. Office was closed over the weekend and I am in hopes someone in the doctors office get back to me tomorrow on Monday to sort it out…On the other hand, the nursing team was good and did what they could after surgery."","
Positief,"""I been to many hospitals. None have ever match the team at The Hospital. You feel safe and comfortable the whole time. They are always trying to make you feel seen and heard. I will never go to any other hospital then there. Thank you so much for the excellent service and GOD bless all of you"","
Positief,"""I went to The Hospital for all of my screenings, preop testing, robotic donor nephrectomy, and post op appointments. I can’t speak highly enough of all of the staff that I have encountered. My surgeon is fantastic, and all of the donor coordinator staff really held my hand and made me feel confident the entire way. I highly recommend The Hospital."","
Positief,"""My friend is in the hospital here currently. They come in at midnight to have her shower. They take 20 minutes or more to take her to the bathroom when she calls them. They set her tray of food on the table that goes over the bed but they don't move the table close enough to her so that she can reach the food. She is on a daily medication via IV. It takes a total of three hours for the bolus and then the meds but they don't start them until 9:00 PM even though the doctor says they can start them at any time. Therefore, she has to be awake until midnight. There seems to be very little CARE in healthCARE. It seems like the overall healthcare system needs to be overhauled in the United States. One of my friends had to go to a hospital in Canada and said what a world of difference it was. I will say the nursing staff here is very nice so maybe they are just understaffed."","
Positief,"""I recently had an amputation, which recovering from is not easy or fast. For weeks I had The Hospital Homecare nurses and they were always amazing. They never made me feel rushed and always provided a good spot in my day. Towards the end of my recovery I needed a little extra attention, and The Hospital wound care is where I ended up. For just over a month, every Friday I'd make my way in, and they would take great care. They always made me feel positive that the wound was getting better, and that made e a difference for me. In the future, if I have the option, I'll always seek The Hospital for my care needs!"","
Positief,"""My overnight stay in the hospital was ok. Had a great view of the lake. I had been there since that morning and I got hungry in the emergency room. The nurse said she would bring me something to eat and didn’t do it until after 4 pm. Right after that someone brought me some hospital food. When I got to a room, my 1st nurse night shift was good. The day shift nurse was ok. They didn’t come right away if you called them. The physical therapist was awesome. She was very helpful and personable. She even called for a nurse to unhook my IV and no one came. They need to work on coming to a room when a patient calls them. I should have went to The Hospital though cause that’s where my cardiologist is."","
Positief,"""The staff was amazing. The doctors were ALL top notch. Everyone actually seemed to care about how I felt or how I thought. The surgery went so well that I left the hospital 4 days after I got there AND once surgery started they found out they had to do extra. These people ARE AMAZING .The hospital staff was incredible. People really cared about how I felt or what I thought. I had Lead Nurses, RN’s, Techs, Occupational therapy, someone just to talk to me about my care at home and what I might need, I am 74. When I get old in 10 years I may need another surgery. Make sure you keep these people around"","
Positief,"""My health has caused many stays or visits to a large number of central florida hospitals. In every category The hospital takes the win . This is the friendliest group of healthcare workers bar none. The extra attention to detail is beyond belief. The Celebration is also in this category. But I feel like these people are doing everything they can to save lives or just make you feel comfortable."","
Positief,"""Amazing hospital and staff were angels. Had my beautiful healthy twins in back December which this hospital made possible after being extremely high risk pregnancy. My babies and i received the best care."","
Positief,"""Doctor is a wonderful transplant doctor, who I respect very much and trust my Care to him. He is an analytical Doctor Who can sometimes lose me with technical terms. He is very seldom given enough time to spend with each one of his patients which causes him to run late on his next appointment, I am a very complicated patient of his and wish that he could get more time to explain my care. My transplant coordinator who I have had for 11 years Cathy Vaskic is the best! If awards were given out I would definitely give one to each of these two."","
Positief,"""Had a baby in July 2024 child was never entered into the computer system can't get birth certificate from vital statistic called over dozen times was told someone would return my call to allow me to know something no return call can't get my child medical attention without birth certificate or social security card can't obtain these until someone at this hospital enters info allowing us to do so"","
Positief,"""The nurses and the rest of the personnel are amazing. The only thing that could be better is on Orlando South (Downtown) they should change were the companion sleeps. My husband couldn't stay every night because was broken."","
Neutraal,"""Informative instructors. Was suppose to get a list of snacks and copies of the 1st class notes given and didn't receive them. Tonight's instructor said she would send out that info along with notes from tonight's class."","
Positief,"""It was my first time is this hospital. I had a minor surgery and I was very well care for and the room was very comfortable and big. The only thing bad about it was the food….oh my!! the food is NOT Good at All not to say Horrible!! From 1-5 I give it a -1. I know this is an Adventist Hospital and they’ll not serve you bacon, but you can actually cook the food and seasoned it. Not open a bag, microwave it and put it on a plate. I also ask for some fruit and they brought me a pre-packed cup of fruit. And when I ask if they had fresh fruit they told me they only give them to the kids., I beg for some and they made an exception and brought me a cup of fresh strawberries. The 2 nights I was there my friends and family had to bring me dinner."","
Negatief,"""The quality of the medical personnel is fine. Where I have a problem is The Hospital holding my test results hostage from me to review before my follow up doctor appointment, which is usually at least a month in the future. Don’t these results belong to me? I paid for the service! Any The Hospital employee can pull up my records and look at them, but I cannot see them until they say I can. Absurd!"","
Positief,"""The Hospital -They are respectful and speak to you in a kind tone. Vs The Hospital they tend to be more on the rude side with staff than those who are tender and kind sympathetic for the patient. It’s like they must be understaffing so the tension is high ."","
Positief,"""The Doctor and the staff are incredibly supportive and kind people. Considering where I go to see them all every 6 mos. Thank you everyone at the Transplant Institute. You are all 6 stars in my book!"","
Positief,"""My husband recently had a kidney transplant at The Hospital. Words can’t express the level of service and commitment the whole team showed. We’re extremely grateful. Thanks to Jordan from the recovery room, Mckenzie, the post op transplant cordinator, Jessica from the 12th floor and all the transplant team."","
Neutraal,"""Nursing staff were very nice. I met the case manager the first morning of my two night stay and never saw her again (so obviously never received the treatment plan update by noon, as promised). I did receive IV antibiotics and blood work as directed in my chart. I waited nearly 24 hours from my meal the prior evening to eat because of the potential for surgery and an order for no food or drink. I understood that ortho was determining if a surgery would be required on my hand and would take a fluid sample in the meantime. Ortho didn’t come to see me until I insisted on knowing if a surgery would be had because I wanted to eat (that was about 23 hours from my last meal). The fluid sample never happened at all. Shortly thereafter an ortho doctor came and told me it was the first he’d been informed of my case. Not long after that, I was advised that I would have surgery that evening. The entire day I waited for treatment, I asked if I could take my blood pressure medicine to which I was told no. The pre op nurse later said I could have taken meds even with the no food or drink order. As a result, I went into surgery with hypertension. Great nursing staff but zero communication between departments and also little communication and follow through with me about my treatment plan. If I hadn’t pressed for a decision about surgery, I think I would have been forgotten and not eaten for at least another day."","
Negatief,"""I was very sick and went to The Hospital. Was in ORMC for 2 months and they couldn’t find out what was wrong with me. I switched to The Hospital and Dr. Soliman found out the problem by first visit and did the surgery. I am very satisfied with The Hospital, best doctors and staff."","
Positief,"""The overall experience with the facility and staff is incredible. I would like to see actual phlebotomists drawing blood instead of assistants as it would make the procedure more pleasant for some of us."","
Positief,"""After contending with their billing department for the past year, I only wish I could have foreseen the ills of their unfavorable antics. Today, I can decisively say that I will never again intertwine my medical care with this hospital nor recommend anyone else to do so. I truly concur with their current rating with the Better Business Bureau."","
Negatief,"""Well they were almost average.... but made a lot of mistakes along the way. I was here for a 5 day stay for multiple tests regarding my epilepsy. Day 3 was a NeuroPsychological Assessment. This assessment ended up getting canceled. The day before the assessment the doctors withheld medication because they needed me to have a seizure for testing. Later that day, that's when I was told the neuropsych test that should have happened the next day was canceled, becuase I had a seizure. I know crazy right? The doctors planned for me to have a seizure on Tuesday and becuase they did that... the wensday testing was canceled. Now I need to reschedule and go back without a car becuase these geniuses we call doctors CLEARLY miscommunicated or are just stupid. They also find ANY opportunity they can to put you on an NPO diet???? That's nothing to drink or eat including water. MRI, PET SCAN, CT SCAN, ETC.... If you are leaving your hospital room for more than 45 minutes they will NPO your diet the night before, really is over kill. Now I'm fighting tooth and nail to get this final test done somewhere here or near, and believe me when I tell you, they are pushing back. All they want is my insurance money it's ridiculous. They are NOT the only facility on earth with a Neuropsychologist, and they are just going to have to come to terms with that."","
Positief,"""I was so impressed by the quality of care that I received recently at The Hospital. I needed unexpected surgery and was reassured throughout the experience by the staff’s kind care and empathy."","
Positief,"""The hospital room in Winter park The Hospital, was so beautiful, and what a veiw, very calming! Only had a problem with 2 nurses and one Doctor not being very prof. and quite rude. But other than that, the rest of the staff was so kind, attentive, caring and gentle. Of coarse most of the food was your typical, bland, blah hospital food,(except watch out for the really spicy chicken sausage!!!) I must give a thumbs up for the meatloaf and gravy!!! And the sweethearts that take your order, well done!!!!! Overall 4 and half stars!"","
Positief,"""This was my 3rd time at this hospital I really enjoyed all the nurses I had especially Matt lol he went over and behind his calling, I had another tech rhat was amazing she came and helped me so much I can’t remember her name but she was incredible they were all amazing!!! The doctor is by far the best doctor I have ever had he’s amazing such a wonderful person, he made this experience more calming for me. One thing I can say that I have experienced twice that was a negative experience is going to that room where they prep you for before surgery Alexander was assigned to me and his shift was ending the doctor came into ask serious questions about me and he was nowhere to be found and nobody had the answer most of the time I was alone they told him I was feeling faint when going to the restroom abd pressure dropped and he just said good to no and left again, I had a woman that was there she was very sweet and came to check on me but I notice they horse play a lot it’s not a great feeling being there to me before surgery your scared and everyone is just joking and talking about nonsense this is the second time that I experienced this. This put a damper on my experience honestly other than that I would rate this hospital a 5"","
Negatief,"""One of the worst hospitals we have been to in a long time if you want your loved one to live please do not bring them here broad my husband in for abdominal pain they ended up removing a kidney transplant which got infected we told them it was infected and they didn't listen to us he almost went septic and then they finally listen to us had to do another surgery to clean him out and here we are doing the third surgery because they didn't listen to us and he has another infection so way to go The Hospital"","
Positief,"""A family member was diagnosed by The hospital with an inoperable brain tumor. We appreciate that our doctor recommended that we get a second opinion, as The hospital could only offer radiation and chemotherapy. Duke Heath was able to successfully perform the operation and prescribe a drug that recently received FDA approval for this specific condition. (Duke Health, along with Johns Hopkins, was involved in the trials for this drug). A second opinion is imperative as hospitals have different specialties."","
Positief,"""Overall experience has been good. Nursing staff at Winter Park and at Rollins campus were wonderful. Nurses seem to take pride in their job and actually care for their patients. Came through ED each time (came in for AFIB) and the Rollins campus was a bad experience. I realize they are a large department but I felt ignored, questions were not answered. Was moved out to the hallway after being moved to 3 different rooms first. Sat there for approximately 4 hrs) waiting for bed to be available, at least that was what I was told. Never spoke to a nurse, never had any questions anawere. After a couple of days being in a room that was basically an old closet, 6x 12, bed not functioning. Electrical outlet was jammed against bed, the electrical out which was cracked and metal of bed was hitting open electrical. (have picture) Slept in a chair, bathroom to small even for one person, I was discharged at 10 pm. The discharge went well due to the type of wheelchair that was used to transport me. When at Winter Park the issue was wheelchair I couldn't use due to my Lymphedema and unable to left legs up high enough to get over foot rest. They then came with a wheelchair w/one arm rest missing and a broken foot rest. Must have come out of garbage. Finally got a stretcher from the ED dept and had to take that down to car. Was told stretcher could not go outside of building. It was such a screwed up mess. The wheelchairs should be the same at each hospital for ease of discharge. I just feel like the nursing staff at both hospitals are kind, caring individuals but the overall feeling is you get lost at Rollins campus due to the size."","
Positief,"""The surgical center has an amazing staff both in pre-op registration and the surgical team! I had the best experience with my surgical procedure at this facility and would definitely recommend the Doctors at The Hospital! The Doctor is the best Neurosurgeon I have seen in Florida, between his knowledge & expertise as a Neurosurgeon, and his wonderful, compassionate bedside manner with patients I give him infinite ⭐️⭐️⭐️ stars ♾️⭐️⭐️♾️!!! Not to mention he is quite pleasing to the eyes & he cares about his patients where he listens and answers questions in layman’s terms!♾️⭐️⭐️♾️ The doctor is an exceptional pulmonologist with exceptional knowledge & skills in his field with an excellent bedside manner as well and also receives 100 Gold Stars!⭐️⭐️⭐️ The best Doctors are here at The Hospital!

Last but not least, the best of the best Pulmonologist at Fish Memorial, The doctor who is exhibits exceptionalism in her profession, and she is wonderful, empathetic & compassionate with patients! Shes top notch and I give her infinite"","
Positief,"""Aven health is the best hospital, im very happy with there service, i have my hip replacement and I don't have any complaints, the doctors, nurse and all staff are very cautious. I recommend Aven health."","
Negatief,"""I am extremely disappointed with my experience with The doctor. After an ultrasound revealed I had fibroids, he recommended and performed a uterine ablation on May 25, 2024, to control my heavy bleeding. The procedure initially seemed effective, as I stopped bleeding for two months. However, in August, I began experiencing severe bleeding again, accompanied by excruciating cramps. During my follow-up, The doctor ordered an MRI, which surprisingly showed that I had no fibroids. This raised serious questions about the initial diagnosis and whether the uterine ablation was necessary. It is frustrating and concerning that an MRI wasn’t considered before recommending surgery, especially given the severity of my symptoms and my trips to the emergency room due to blood loss. Additionally, at each appointment, The Doctor seemed unfamiliar with my case, often appearing disconnected from the details in my chart. When I mentioned the side effects of a medication he prescribed, he didn’t seem to remember it, which made me feel unheard and unsupported. Although he was initially nice, his demeanor changed when my symptoms persisted, making me feel dismissed and uncomfortable. I have recorded conversations for my reference, and this experience has led me to seek a new OB-GYN who can provide the empathy and thoroughness that every patient deserves. This has been a challenging journey, and I hope my review can help others make an informed decision about their healthcare provider."","
Positief,"""The nurse practioners at The Hospital are top notch! Both Mayra and Debbie are knowledgeable and compassionate with their patients. I feel that I'm in good hands under their care."","
Positief,"""Absolutely the Best care I have received anywhere! Incredible bedside manner, and were incredible at diagnosing and treating my issues. I feel lucky to have them."","
Positief,"""I gave birth to my first baby (boy) here and it was the best experience of my life. I would travel from wherever im at in the united states back to florida to The Hospital to give birth. I would love all my kids to be born here. The team and care I received was so extraordinary. Thank you so much to everyone in the labor and delivery department for helping me bring life into this world"","
Positief,"""The reason why I give a three because the staff in your hospital need more help. especially the nurses and dietretion. Dietretion need more help to deliver the patient food earlier. Why food come at 6.30 in the evening and breakfast at half nine. Second the nurses don't have enough hands to be caring for patient needs and medications. When you call for a nurse for emergency purpose you of to wait a long period of time. A person can died in that space of time. I don't understand why The Hospital don't have head Nurse or nurse as supervisor to cover for nurses when they are busy. You should have Supervisor nurse on each floor. That's what happened in a good company they have managers and supervisor in various department. They step in, when all stuff are busy. I find younger nurse more patient, understandable & wonderful much more than older nurses. I wanted The Hospital to bring back disposal wipes to clean the rooms. Why used one piece of cloth to clean ever where. My bed my remote for the TV was clean with same piece of cloth. And that same piece of cloth clean the sink and the bathroom. Thats not hygiene That cloth must be full with bacteria and virus. Please use disposal Wipes to clean room and bathroom. I was in the hospital room from Saturday to Monday and my room only clean ones by that cloth. Disgusting. I study hygiene and I didn't see that practices in my room when I was there. People come to the hospital to get better not to sick."","
Negatief,"""Unorganized, some of the staff were rude. I had a prepayment amount of $53.00 when I registered but when I got there it was almost $800. Had to go to 2 different places. walk all across the building and then the hospital. When they should have scheduled both test in the same location. Had a 10am appt for the lumbar but didn’t get in til noon. Very unhappy with the whole situation, when the last time everything was smooth."","
Negatief,"""I have been admitted a few times at the Celebration location. I needed bloodwork done and the only location that had a time available when I needed it. It was very confusing to find the lab. I went to the front desk. She gave me an outdated card with instructions. I walked for 20 minutes. The lab is literally as far away from the hospital as possible. It’s on the 3rd floor in the cancer building. Little to no signage for it. While the lab itself was nice. The address on the app for the lab should be updated to show the actual room number."","
Positief,"""On discharge the nurses and I forgot to remove the apparatus for infusions. Unfortunately the intercom operator was very unsatisfacyory. It took 2 or 3 calls for any action. That could definitely could be improved. The nurses seemed to know their jobs and that was good. The nurses were pleasant and helpful. I need to meet with doctors to know the results of the bloodwork and other tests. Being in hospital meant a constant heart monitoring and more blood draws as needed. I’m here for another day. I hope there will be a plan for improved heart function and breathing. Thank you The Hospital for your care."","
Positief,"""The nurses were so kind and informative. They seemed truly happy to be there. The entire visit was prompt and we felt prioritized. The facility is also very clean and modern."","
Positief,"""The entire staff was so Professional and took time to explain things and showed such a caring attitude. They helped me so much and listened and helped me understand what was going on with my situation! I thank all for your Kindness and good care!!!!"","
Positief,"""For my husband's very difficult and major experience with his LVAD implant and journey - we couldn't have had a more supportive & informative medical team. The nursing staff was phenomenal!! The entire team and staff were always positive, encouraging, professional, & as accommodating as possible. They made a difficult situation as good as it could be. Thank you all!!!"","
Neutraal,"""This rating is not because of a bad medical service. This rating is for the irresponsible staff and administrators to contact me or my family after the hospital staff loss my father’s dentures and eye glasses. My father has been hospitalized for almost a month at the The Hospital were they performed a cardiac bypass surgery. In the process of getting him ready for surgery, transport to surgery or after surgery his dentures and eye glasses went missing. The hospital staff is currently giving us the run around, no one knows, no one is coming forward, and we are trying to find out what can be done. My dad is 76 yrs old, his dentures and eye glasses were optioned through the great service of VA benefits. In order for him to get his dentures done he has to go again and get his impressions done and x-rays but he is still hospitalized and will continue to be in the hospital for several weeks or even another month. My dad needs his dentures and we want this problem to resolved ASAP without excuses and without making us (family) do what the hospital should’ve done from the time they were notified his belongings were missing."","
Positief,"""If you are transgender like I am then be prepared for the worst. Getting my dead name screeched out despite putting in my 'prefered name' and the paraded around getting called 'sir' and 'papa'. Definitely made me feel great especially hearing some of the reception laughing at me. And there was also one old man who I think is a nurse that decided making a joke involving me beating up my girlfriend was a great idea. The actual doctors are fantastic. I didn't have health insurance and they were able to help me out a lot."","
Negatief,"""Absolutely disgusting and terrible place to go. Unorganized and improper communication with nurses. The nurse I had did not care. The restroom was nasty with diarrhea all on the seat. The nurse sat on my bed with no mask on. She left blood all around my iv line in my hand. no idea of what tests I was supposed to have and the dr didn't even bother to see me beforr discharge. prescribed me prescriptions but couldn't tell me what was weong with me. Don't go to there they will not help you."","
Negatief,"""Zero stars is more like it , I came to the hospital due to some excruciating chest pain. Everything was going well the staff was friendly and pretty fast paste. Once I got in my room I had to have a IV in my arm and they had to form a EKG. They wait 30 mins to one hour my results will come. Cool. No problem. I’m very patient. Two hours went by I buzzed for the nurse on the remote. No one came. 20 mins went by no one came. I kept asking for a nurse and no one came. My IV was empty with no fluids. Still no nurse after two attempts of getting up and walking outside the door. Finally I got up to leave on my own and that’s when the doctor decided to say my results are here. Smh I never experienced such POOR service from a hospital. Please no one go here."","
Negatief,"""This place is a complete joke! I came in by ambulance from my passing out ( I knew I had type A flu) . I have multiple health risks which the illness can make worse. my pulse rate was abnormally low and blood pressure too low. The doctor comes in for two minutes didn't care to hear anything i had to say. says he's just gonna give iv fluids and leaves. of course they swab me for flu and covid. I told the nurse i already know i have the flu not covid. once again don't listen. then last minute does a terrible job at a ekg. doesn't even leave it on for 10 seconds and says ok done. he puts the iv on and leaves. 15minutes later some other staff member comes in says here is your discharge follow up with your primary. My iv bag wasn't even finished so much for thinking i was dehydrated and no doctor came in to even tell me what the ekg or anything. left there with still feeling lightheaded and a low blood pressure and pulse rate. They did nothing but patient dump me. They are useless!!"","
Negatief,"""Went into the E.R. today, one of there nurses there was inserting the iv into my fore arm and missed the vein and instead of pulling it out and retrying he keep the missed needle in my arm jolting it around trying to hit the vein. Where do they hire there nurses from?"","
Negatief,"""If you are admitted to the hospital, it’s probably the worst thing that can happen to you. They treat you like crap! They forget to do their rounds and are off on needed medication. Especially for pain. The nutrition people who come in are extremely rude. And the pharmacy accused me of already having my prescription at discharge when I didn’t and told me there was nothing they could do. The manager told me to leave and go check my room which I knew they didn’t deliver it to me. All for them to deliver my medication to the wrong nurse and patient! Someone else had signed for my medication. I end up getting it back. And they just handed it to me with no apology on their mistakes or how they treated me. I have called and left messages for upper management at pharmacy in regards to this incident. No one called back. I even called patient relations and left a message. No one called back. I will NEVER deal with advent again for future care."","
Negatief,"""This hospital starves their patients, lacks communication among nurses AND doctors, neglects to answer simple questions and do the necessary due diligence pre-surgery and pre-discharge of a patient. Nurses tell patients they have 1 job and 1 job only, refuse to make notes for any requests that are not 'in their area' and often forget about patients for hours. The hospital also picks up the phone and hangs up immediately or transfers you suddenly to an operator who infamously said, 'I need a pay raise. I don't know why they keep doing this.' I don't know what the intentions of the people who work or run this facility are, but in my experience it continues to go against their oaths and human rights."","
Negatief,"""I once loved this hospital, I've encouraged people to go there but never again. The staff was unavailable, they ignored a patient and ignored families request for information. After being served with a medical power of attorney they still ignored the patients choice of care proceeded against the wishes of all, 'lost' the patient, lied about the patient being in thier care then discharged the patient without proper discharge and with medical equiptment such as a picc line still in the patient to a halfway house after being fully instructed that at home care had been arranged and patient was discharging home. The staff here was horrible. They ignored patients needs. Refused patient the right to informed decisions, and I wouldn't recomend this place to anyone ever. They have gone hill. If hospitals were nieghborhoods this one would be skidrow. NEVER BEEN MORE DISAPPOINTED IN MY LIFE. shame on you Adventhealth, way to lower the bar!"","
Positief,"""I understand that waiting to be seen can take a while but why did it take over a hour and a half to get my discharge paper work. Went in the morning before it was overly busy. People who were seen way after me were leaving way before me. The only reason I was able to leave after such a huge wait time was because I went up to the desk to find out what was going on. Then proceeded to wait by the desk. The first thing that happened was the front desk people telling me they don't know what's causing it to take so long since I was to be waiting for the care rep to talk to me, which he did already( quite some time ago).So there system wasn't even up to date on my leaving process. The care rep couldn't even make the follow up appointment for me! So what was the point in waiting for them anyway when I have to call the number on the paper myself anyway! I went here because I heard it was good, only to have a terrible time while in pain. Be careful and would not recommend."","
Negatief,"""I would die before going to this hospital....oh wait I almost did when they let me leave and highlight on discharge papers what was wrong... I ended up at the proper place for proper care 24 hours later. Total disregard for peoples health!!! The other hospital even called and yelled at them for there treatment. Then have the nerve to want me to pay a $900 bill. Even after I submitted the docs they asked for. Did I mention they dont care!!!"","
Negatief,"""This is seriously the worst hospital I’ve ever been to. They take long for everything once they did all the ta on me I waited over an hour just to get my discharge papers.."","
Positief,"""Don't go to this hospital, ever! My 19 year old son went to the Hospital after being seen at an urgent care facility for a pain in his chest. They did an EKG and took an Xray and told him there was nothing wrong with him and waited over an hour for discharge paperwork. Urgent care charged him $500 and the Hospital charged him $6,000!! After I called and wrote a letter, they agreed to 'review' the bill, only to come back and say it was correct. Rip Off - Dont go!"","
Positief,"""Good hospital & good surgeons but SOME of the nurses lack patience & empathy. I understand, It's not an easy job, but you have to keep in mind your patient is in pain and going through a rough time while recovering. Otherwise, this hospital is beyond amazing. I spent a week in ICU and it wasn't too bad I just wish they allowed younger visitors."","
Positief,"""The care received from Advent is superior. The communication between Nursing staff and between different floors when a loved has been moved is less than desirable. There needs to be one registration when a person is admitted to gather information needed. Not 2nd day and 5 phone calls within 30 minutes from 5 different people. Nurses need to be trained on how to address the family as well as the patient. When it should say on a chart notify daughter of any testing than they should be notified not find out about it a day later then when it was ordered and having the procedure being done when they get to hospital. All in all Advent is my hospital of choice"","
Positief,"""Horrible experience!! Went to get x-ray and the line was so long and no reception at front desk at the front door then no reception in x ray room. Rang bell and it took almost 3 minutes for someone to come. I ended up leaving because line was so long it was blocking door. I'm not from Florida. Texas hospital is way more helpful and better. Parking Lot was so far and valet line was long. Hospital was clean and huge. It was Friday at 12:30. Nurses were just coming in from lunch ( that was what they said ) Maybe my experience will be better next time. Not!!!"","
Positief,"""All of the nurses were great. What was not great was being told I can't wait outside of my wife's room while they take one minute to help her. I am appalled by how I was treated since she acted as if I was in the wrong since they politely asked me to step out and even accused me of sitting there all day. A man shouldnt have to step away from his wife while she is in labor. Disgusting the way I was treated."","
Negatief,"""The service was horrible. I would call 3 time for a nurse to come in and they wouldn’t. They left me in a room for 2 days with no fluids but gave me medicine to have me go to the bathroom every 20 minutes (I was getting dehydrated). They discharged me and sent me home with pain meds that didn’t work. Before discharging me they asked me if I wanted to leave and I would let them know that I want to stay because I am still in pain.I had to go to another hospital to find out I had pneumonia after being discharged. When shift change happened at 7 I didn’t even know who my nurse was until 9 when I was crying for pain medicine and they finally came in after calling for a while. I felt abandoned and lost."","
Negatief,"""My mother is in a coma in Hospice, and this has been a journey through Hell. First of all I am the only child living far away and the nurses will not answer questions will not return calls will not even tell me if she has passed yet! Also I keep getting transferred to someone with whom's English is horrible!!! And then there are nurses that say I haven't heard of her or the hospice floor. This is a cattle lot. Patients aren't people and family members are a joke to them. This Hospital gets a rating of -10. And you have to color a star to post. Well let that star be a stain on your record!!!!!"","
Negatief,"""Blood in the waiting room. Staff not compassionate and I waited over 20mins and never had anyone come in my room at the ER. Severe pain and had to go to the nurse station only to be greeted by the rudest nurse I've ever had an encounter with. Left after that never seeing anyone."","
Negatief,"""Terrible experience with the nurses at the hospital which is shocking because people say they are the best. Literally visited each floor because of my loved one (poor dad) in care and the 9th floor is the worst! The nurses are rude and think they are God's gift to the world. Why choose that career if you're going to be mean or careless. Terrible experience. Do not donate your money to this organization. If they'll lie about how caring they are who knows what else they will lie about."","
Negatief,"""If i could give no stars i definitly would. Absolute WORST hospital I have ever been to. The nurses dont care about you and you never get to see a doctor until you are about to get discharged. All the staff here treat you like garbage . They gave me way too many IV bags to the point where i was getting swollen and they refused to acknowledge that. My face, arms and torso were completely swollen from the fluid which they refused to stop. The nurses like to lie to you and scare you to get information out of you. I cant even fathom how unprofessional the staff here is. Discharge is a damn joke. No one tells you anything, they wont let you read what your signing, and they shoo you away then say 'oh by the way whatever you said is on your medical records now. Its gonna impact how insurances cover you and what doctors choose to see you, making it alot more difficult for you to be seen :) ' .... I could have died but i chose to come to this AWFUL hospital thinking i was going to be okay. Now I have a 15 grand bill for 1 day there, super swollen, and Lord knows what they wrote on my medical records. They really could care less about their patients. Please save yourself and go somewhere else."","
